# Introduction

Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for getting started instructions, they've moved to their own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

Many different kinds of people use React Native: from advanced iOS developers to React beginners, to people getting started programming for the first time in their career. These docs were written for all learners, no matter their experience level or background.

### How to use these docs

You can start here and read through these docs linearly like a book; or you can read the specific sections you need. Already familiar with React? You can skip that section—or read it for a light refresher.

### Prerequisites

To work with React Native, you will need to have an understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. If you’re new to JavaScript or need a refresher, you can dive in or brush up at Mozilla Developer Network.

> While we do our best to assume no prior knowledge of React, Android, or iOS development, these are valuable topics of study for the aspiring React Native developer. Where sensible, we have linked to resources and articles that go more in depth.

### Interactive examples

This introduction lets you get started immediately in your browser with interactive examples like this one:

The above is a Snack Player. It’s a handy tool created by Expo to embed and run React Native projects and share how they render in platforms like Android and iOS. The code is live and editable, so you can play directly with it in your browser. Go ahead and try changing the "Try editing me!" text above to "Hello, world!"

> Optionally, if you want to set up a local development environment, you can follow our guide to setting up your environment on your local machine and paste the code examples into your project. (If you are a web developer, you may already have a local environment set up for mobile browser testing!)

### Developer Notes

People from many different development backgrounds are learning React Native. You may have experience with a range of technologies, from web to Android to iOS and more. We try to write for developers from all backgrounds. Sometimes we provide explanations specific to one platform or another like so:

- Android
- iOS
- Web

> Android developers may be familiar with this concept.

> iOS developers may be familiar with this concept.

> Web developers may be familiar with this concept.

### Formatting

Menu paths are written in bold and use carets to navigate submenus. Example: **Android Studio > Preferences**

Now that you know how this guide works, it's time to get to know the foundation of React Native: Native Components.

## Alert

Launches an alert dialog with the specified title and message.

Optionally provide a list of buttons. Tapping any button will fire the respective onPress callback and dismiss the alert. By default, the only button will be an 'OK' button.

This is an API that works both on Android and iOS and can show static alerts. Alert that prompts the user to enter some information is available on iOS only.

### Example

### iOS

On iOS you can specify any number of buttons. Each button can optionally specify a style or be emphasized, available options are represented by the AlertButtonStyle enum and the `isPreferred` field on AlertButton.

### Android

On Android at most three buttons can be specified. Android has a concept of a neutral, negative and a positive button:

- If you specify one button, it will be the 'positive' one (such as 'OK')
- Two buttons mean 'negative', 'positive' (such as 'Cancel', 'OK')
- Three buttons mean 'neutral', 'negative', 'positive' (such as 'Later', 'Cancel', 'OK')

Alerts on Android can be dismissed by tapping outside of the alert box. It is disabled by default and can be enabled by providing an optional AlertOptions parameter with the cancelable property set to `true` i.e.\
`{cancelable: true}`.

The cancel event can be handled by providing an `onDismiss` callback property inside the `options` parameter.

## Linking

`Linking` gives you a general interface to interact with both incoming and outgoing app links.

Every Link (URL) has a URL Scheme, some websites are prefixed with `https://` or `http://` and the `http` is the URL Scheme. Let's call it scheme for short.

In addition to `https`, you're likely also familiar with the `mailto` scheme. When you open a link with the mailto scheme, your operating system will open an installed mail application. Similarly, there are schemes for making phone calls and sending SMS. Read more about built-in URL schemes below.

Like using the mailto scheme, it's possible to link to other applications by using custom url schemes. For example, when you get a **Magic Link** email from Slack, the **Launch Slack** button is an anchor tag with an href that looks something like: `slack://secret/magic-login/other-secret`. Like with Slack, you can tell the operating system that you want to handle a custom scheme. When the Slack app opens, it receives the URL that was used to open it. This is often referred to as deep linking. Read more about how to get the deep link into your app.

A custom URL scheme isn't the only way to open your application on mobile. For example, if you want to email someone a link to be opened on mobile, using a custom URL scheme isn't ideal because the user might open the email on a desktop, where the link wouldn't work. Instead, you should use standard `https` links, such as `https://www.myapp.io/records/1234546`. On mobile, these links can be configured to open your app. On Android, this feature is called **Deep Links**, while on iOS, it is known as **Universal Links**.

#### Built-in URL Schemes

As mentioned in the introduction, there are some URL schemes for core functionality that exist on every platform. The following is a non-exhaustive list, but covers the most commonly used schemes.

| Scheme | Description | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mailto` | Open mail app, eg: mailto: <support@expo.io> | ✅ | ✅ |
| `tel` | Open phone app, eg: tel:+123456789 | ✅ | ✅ |
| `sms` | Open SMS app, eg: sms:+123456789 | ✅ | ✅ |
| `https` / `http` | Open web browser app, eg: <https://expo.io> | ✅ | ✅ |

#### Enabling Deep Links

#### Projects with Native Code Only

The following section only applies to projects with native code exposed. If you are using the managed Expo workflow, see the guide on Linking in the Expo documentation for the appropriate alternative.

If you want to enable deep links in your app, please read the below guide:

- Android
- iOS

> For instructions on how to add support for deep linking on Android, refer to Enabling Deep Links for App Content - Add Intent Filters for Your Deep Links.

If you wish to receive the intent in an existing instance of MainActivity, you may set the `launchMode` of MainActivity to `singleTask` in `AndroidManifest.xml`. See `<activity>` documentation for more information.

xml

```
<activity
  android:name=".MainActivity"
  android:launchMode="singleTask">
```

> **NOTE:** On iOS, you'll need to add the `LinkingIOS` folder into your header search paths as described in step 3 here. If you also want to listen to incoming app links during your app's execution, you'll need to add the following lines to your `*AppDelegate.m`:

- ObjectiveC
- Swift

AppDelegate.mm

```
// iOS 9.x or newer
#import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
   openURL:(NSURL *)url
   options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options
{
  return [RCTLinkingManager application:application openURL:url options:options];
}
```

If your app is using Universal Links, you'll need to add the following code as well:

AppDelegate.mm

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity:(nonnull NSUserActivity *)userActivity
 restorationHandler:(nonnull void (^)(NSArray<id<UIUserActivityRestoring>> * _Nullable))restorationHandler
{
 return [RCTLinkingManager application:application
                  continueUserActivity:userActivity
                    restorationHandler:restorationHandler];
}
```

AppDelegate.swift

```
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
  return RCTLinkingManager.application(app, open: url, options: options)
}
```

If your app is using Universal Links, you'll need to add the following code as well:

AppDelegate.swift

```
func application(
  _ application: UIApplication,
  continue userActivity: NSUserActivity,
  restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    return RCTLinkingManager.application(
      application,
      continue: userActivity,
      restorationHandler: restorationHandler
    )
  }
```

#### Handling Deep Links

There are two ways to handle URLs that open your app.

##### 1. If the app is already open, the app is foregrounded and a Linking 'url' event is fired

You can handle these events with `Linking.addEventListener('url', callback)` - it calls `callback({url})` with the linked URL

##### 2. If the app is not already open, it is opened and the url is passed in as the initialURL

You can handle these events with `Linking.getInitialURL()` - it returns a Promise that resolves to the URL, if there is one.

---

### Example

#### Open Links and Deep Links (Universal Links)

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

#### Open Custom Settings

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

#### Get the Deep Link

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

#### Send Intents (Android)

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

### Reference

### Methods

#### `addEventListener()`

```
static addEventListener(
  type: 'url',
  handler: (event: {url: string}) => void,
): EmitterSubscription;
```

Add a handler to Linking changes by listening to the `url` event type and providing the handler.

---

#### `canOpenURL()`

```
static canOpenURL(url: string): Promise<boolean>;
```

Determine whether or not an installed app can handle a given URL.

The method returns a `Promise` object. When it is determined whether or not the given URL can be handled, the promise is resolved and the first parameter is whether or not it can be opened.

The `Promise` will reject on Android if it was impossible to check if the URL can be opened or when targeting Android 11 (SDK 30) if you didn't specify the relevant intent queries in `AndroidManifest.xml`. Similarly on iOS, the promise will reject if you didn't add the specific scheme in the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` key inside `Info.plist` (see bellow).

**Parameters:**

| Name        | Type   | Description      |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| urlRequired | string | The URL to open. |

> For web URLs, the protocol (`"http://"`, `"https://"`) must be set accordingly!

> This method has limitations on iOS 9+. From the official Apple documentation:
>
> - If your app is linked against an earlier version of iOS but is running in iOS 9.0 or later, you can call this method up to 50 times. After reaching that limit, subsequent calls always resolve to `false`. If the user reinstalls or upgrades the app, iOS resets the limit.
>
> As of iOS 9, your app also needs to provide the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` key inside `Info.plist` or `canOpenURL()` will always resolve to `false`.

> When targeting Android 11 (SDK 30) you must specify the intents for the schemes you want to handle in `AndroidManifest.xml`. A list of common intents can be found here.
>
> For example to handle `https` schemes the following needs to be added to your manifest:
>
> ```
> <manifest ...>
>     <queries>
>         <intent>
>             <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
>             <data android:scheme="https"/>
>         </intent>
>     </queries>
> </manifest>
> ```

---

#### `getInitialURL()`

```
static getInitialURL(): Promise<string | null>;
```

If the app launch was triggered by an app link, it will give the link url, otherwise it will give `null`.

> To support deep linking on Android, refer <https://developer.android.com/training/app-indexing/deep-linking.html#handling-intents>

> getInitialURL may return `null` when Remote JS Debugging is active. Disable the debugger to ensure it gets passed.

---

#### `openSettings()`

```
static openSettings(): Promise<void>;
```

Open the Settings app and displays the app’s custom settings, if it has any.

---

#### `openURL()`

```
static openURL(url: string): Promise<any>;
```

Try to open the given `url` with any of the installed apps.

You can use other URLs, like a location (e.g. "geo:37.484847,-122.148386" on Android or "<https://maps.apple.com/?ll=37.484847,-122.148386>" on iOS), a contact, or any other URL that can be opened with the installed apps.

The method returns a `Promise` object. If the user confirms the open dialog or the url automatically opens, the promise is resolved. If the user cancels the open dialog or there are no registered applications for the url, the promise is rejected.

**Parameters:**

| Name        | Type   | Description      |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| urlRequired | string | The URL to open. |

> This method will fail if the system doesn't know how to open the specified URL. If you're passing in a non-http(s) URL, it's best to check `canOpenURL()` first.

> For web URLs, the protocol (`"http://"`, `"https://"`) must be set accordingly!

> This method may behave differently in a simulator e.g. `"tel:"` links are not able to be handled in the iOS simulator as there's no access to the dialer app.

---

#### `sendIntent()`Android

```
static sendIntent(
  action: string,
  extras?: Array<{key: string; value: string | number | boolean}>,
): Promise<void>;
```

Launch an Android intent with extras.

**Parameters:**

| Name           | Type                                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| actionRequired | string                                                     |
| extras         | `Array<{key: string, value: string ｜ number ｜ boolean}>` |

## ActionSheetIOS

Displays native to iOS Action Sheet component.

### Example

### Reference

### Methods

#### `showActionSheetWithOptions()`

```
static showActionSheetWithOptions: (
  options: ActionSheetIOSOptions,
  callback: (buttonIndex: number) => void,
);
```

Display an iOS action sheet. The `options` object must contain one or more of:

- `options` (array of strings) - a list of button titles (required)
- `cancelButtonIndex` (int) - index of cancel button in `options`
- `cancelButtonTintColor` (string) - the color used for the change the text color of the cancel button
- `destructiveButtonIndex` (int or array of ints) - indices of destructive buttons in `options`
- `title` (string) - a title to show above the action sheet
- `message` (string) - a message to show below the title
- `anchor` (number) - the node to which the action sheet should be anchored (used for iPad)
- `tintColor` (string) - the color used for non-destructive button titles
- `disabledButtonIndices` (array of numbers) - a list of button indices which should be disabled
- `userInterfaceStyle` (string) - the interface style used for the action sheet, can be set to `light` or `dark`, otherwise the default system style will be used

The 'callback' function takes one parameter, the zero-based index of the selected item.

Minimal example:

```
ActionSheetIOS.showActionSheetWithOptions(
  {
    options: ['Cancel', 'Remove'],
    destructiveButtonIndex: 1,
    cancelButtonIndex: 0,
  },
  buttonIndex => {
    if (buttonIndex === 1) {
      /* destructive action */
    }
  },
);
```

---

#### `dismissActionSheet()`

```
static dismissActionSheet();
```

Dismisses the most upper iOS action sheet presented, if no action sheet is present a warning is displayed.

---

#### `showShareActionSheetWithOptions()`

```
static showShareActionSheetWithOptions: (
  options: ShareActionSheetIOSOptions,
  failureCallback: (error: Error) => void,
  successCallback: (success: boolean, method: string) => void,
);
```

Display the iOS share sheet. The `options` object should contain one or both of `message` and `url` and can additionally have a `subject` or `excludedActivityTypes`:

- `url` (string) - a URL to share
- `message` (string) - a message to share
- `subject` (string) - a subject for the message
- `excludedActivityTypes` (array) - the activities to exclude from the ActionSheet

> **Note:** If `url` points to a local file, or is a base64-encoded uri, the file it points to will be loaded and shared directly. In this way, you can share images, videos, PDF files, etc. If `url` points to a remote file or address it must conform to URL format as described in RFC 2396. For example, a web URL without a proper protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) will not be shared.

The 'failureCallback' function takes one parameter, an error object. The only property defined on this object is an optional `stack` property of type `string`.

The 'successCallback' function takes two parameters:

- a boolean value signifying success or failure

- a string that, in the case of success, indicates the method of sharing

## Appendix

### I. Terminology

- **Spec** - TypeScript or Flow code that describes the API for a Turbo Native Module or Fabric Native component. Used by **Codegen** to generate boilerplate code.

- **Native Modules** - Native libraries that have no User Interface (UI) for the user. Examples would be persistent storage, notifications, network events. These are accessible to your JavaScript application code as functions and objects.

- **Native Component** - Native platform views that are available to your application JavaScript code through React Components.

- **Legacy Native Components** - Components which are running on the old React Native architecture.

- **Legacy Native Modules** - Modules which are running on the old React Native architecture.

### II. Codegen Typings

You may use the following table as a reference for which types are supported and what they map to in each platform:

| Flow | TypeScript | Flow Nullable Support | TypeScript Nullable Support | Android (Java) | iOS (ObjC) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `string` | `string` | `?string` | `string \| null` | `string` | `NSString` |
| `boolean` | `boolean` | `?boolean` | `boolean \| null` | `Boolean` | `NSNumber` |
| Object Literal `{\| foo: string, ...\|}` | `{ foo: string, ...} as const` | `?{\| foo: string, ...\|}` | `?{ foo: string, ...} as const` | - | - |
| Object \[1] | Object \[1] | `?Object` | `Object \| null` | `ReadableMap` | `@` (untyped dictionary) |
| `Array<T>` | `Array<T>` | `?Array<T>` | `Array<T> \| null` | `ReadableArray` | `NSArray` (or `RCTConvertVecToArray` when used inside objects) |
| `Function` | `Function` | `?Function` | `Function \| null` | - | - |
| `Promise<T>` | `Promise<T>` | `?Promise<T>` | `Promise<T> \| null` | `com.facebook.react.bridge.Promise` | `RCTPromiseResolve` and `RCTPromiseRejectBlock` |
| Type Unions `'SUCCESS'\|'FAIL'` | Type Unions `'SUCCESS'\|'FAIL'` | Only as callbacks |  | - | - |
| Callbacks `() =>` | Callbacks `() =>` | Yes |  | `com.facebook.react.bridge.Callback` | `RCTResponseSenderBlock` |
| `number` | `number` | No |  | `double` | `NSNumber` |

#### Notes:

**\[1]** We strongly recommend using Object literals instead of Objects.

info

You may also find it useful to refer to the JavaScript specifications for the core modules in React Native. These are located inside the `Libraries/` directory in the React Native repository.

React Native has a rich ecosystem of libraries to solve common problems. We collect React Native libraries in the reactnative.directory website, and this is a great resource to bookmark for every React Native developer.

Sometimes, you might be working on a module that is worth extracting in a separate library for code reuse. This can be a library that you want to reuse in all your apps, a library that you want to distribute to the ecosystem as an open source component, or even a library you'd like to sell.

In this guide, you'll learn:

- how to extract a module into a library
- how to distribute the library using NPM

## Extract the Module into a Library

You can use the `create-react-native-library` tool to create a new library. This tool sets up a new library with all the boilerplate code that is needed: all the configuration files and all files required by the various platforms. It also comes with a nice interactive menu to guide you through the creation of the library.

To extract a module into a separate library, you can follow these steps:

1. Create the new library
2. Move the code from the App to the Library
3. Update the code to reflect the new structure
4. Publish it.

#### 1. Create a Library

1. Start the creation process by running the command:

sh

```
npx create-react-native-library@latest <Name of Your Library>
```

2. Add a name for your module. It must be a valid npm name, so it should be all lowercase. You can use `-` to separate words.
3. Add a description for the package.
4. Continue filling the form until you reach the question _"What type of library do you want to develop?"_&#x20;
5. For the sake of this guide, select the _Turbo module_ option. Notice that you can create libraries for both New Architecture and Legacy Architecture.
6. Then, you can choose whether you want a library that access the platform (Kotlin & Objective-C) or a shared C++ library (C++ for Android and iOS).
7. Finally, select the `Test App` as last option. This option creates the library with a separate app already configured within the library folder.

Once the interactive prompt is done, the tool creates a folder whose structure looks like this in Visual Studio Code:

Feel free to explore the code that has been created for you. However, the most important parts:

- The `android` folder: this is where the Android code lives
- The `cpp` folder: this is where we the c++ code lives
- The `ios` folder: this is where we the iOS code lives
- The `src` folder: this is where the JS code lives.

The `package.json` is already configured with all the information that we provided to the `create-react-native-library` tool, including the name and the description of the package. Notice that the `package.json` is also already configured to run Codegen.

json

```
  "codegenConfig": {
    "name": "RN<your module name>Spec",
    "type": "all",
    "jsSrcsDir": "src",
    "outputDir": {
      "ios": "ios/generated",
      "android": "android/generated"
    },
    "android": {
      "javaPackageName": "com.<name-of-the-module>"
    }
  },
```

Finally, the library contains already all the infrastructure to let the library be linked with iOS and Android.

#### 2. Copy the Code over from Your App

The rest of the guide assumes that you have a local Turbo Native Module in your app, created following the guidelines shown in the other guides in the website: platform specific Turbo Native Modules, or cross-platform Turbo Native Modules. But it works also for Components and legacy architecture modules and components. You'll have to adapt the files you need to copy and update.

1. **\[Not required for legacy architecture modules and components]** Move the code you have in the `specs` folder in your app into the `src` folder created by the `create-react-native-library` folder.
2. Update the `index.ts` file to properly export the Turbo Native Module spec so that it is accessible from the library. For example:

ts

```
import NativeSampleModule from './NativeSampleModule';

export default NativeSampleModule;
```

3. Copy the native module over:

   - Replace the code in the `android/src/main/java/com/<name-of-the-module>` with the code you wrote in the app for your native module, if any.
   - Replace the code in the `ios` folder with the code you wrote in your app for your native module, if any.
   - Replace the code in the `cpp` folder with the code you wrote in your app for your native module, if any.

4. **\[Not required for legacy architecture modules and components]** Update all the references from the previous spec name to the new spec name, the one that is defined in the `codegenConfig` field of the library's `package.json`. For example, if in the app `package.json` you set `AppSpecs` as `codegenConfig.name` and in the library it is called `RNNativeSampleModuleSpec`, you have to replace every occurrence of `AppSpecs` with `RNNativeSampleModuleSpec`.

That's it! You have moved all the required code out of your app and in a separate library.

### Testing your Library

The `create-react-native-library` comes with a useful example application that is already configured to work properly with the library. This is a great way to test it!

If you look at the `example` folder, you can find the same structure of a new React Native application that you can create from the `react-native-community/template`.

To test your library:

1. Navigate to the `example` folder.
2. Run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.
3. For iOS only, you need to install CocoaPods: `cd ios && pod install`.
4. Build and run Android with `yarn android` from the `example` folder.
5. Build and run iOS with `yarn ios` from the `example` folder.

### Use your library as a Local Module

There are some scenario where you might want to reuse your library as a local module for your applications, without publishing it to NPM.

In this case, you might end up in a scenario where you have your library sitting as a sibling of your apps.

shell

```
Development
├── App
└── Library
```

You can use the library created with `create-react-native-library` also in this case.

1. add you library to your app by navigating into the `App` folder and running `yarn add ../Library`.
2. For iOS only, navigate in the `App/ios` folder and run `bundle exec pod install` to install your dependencies.
3. Update the `App.tsx` code to import the code in your library. For example:

```
import NativeSampleModule from '../Library/src/index';
```

If you run your app right now, Metro would not find the JS files that it needs to serve to the app. That's because metro will be running starting from the `App` folder and it would not have access to the JS files located in the `Library` folder. To fix this, let's update the `metro.config.js` file as it follows

diff

```
const {getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig} = require('@react-native/metro-config');

/**
 * Metro configuration
 * https://reactnative.dev/docs/metro
 *
 * @type {import('metro-config').MetroConfig}
 */
+ const path = require('path');

- const config = {}
+ const config = {
+  // Make Metro able to resolve required external dependencies
+  watchFolders: [
+    path.resolve(__dirname, '../Library'),
+  ],
+  resolver: {
+    extraNodeModules: {
+      'react-native': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/react-native'),
+    },
+  },
+};

module.exports = mergeConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), config);
```

The `watchFolders` configs tells Metro to watch for files and changes in some additional paths, in this case to the `../Library` path, which contains the `src/index` file you need. The `resolver`property is required to feed to the library the React Native code used by the app. The library might refer and import code from React Native: without the additional resolver, the imports in the library will fail.

At this point, you can build and run your app as usual:

- Build and run Android with `yarn android` from the `example` folder.
- Build and run iOS with `yarn ios` from the `example` folder.

### Publish the Library on NPM

The setup to publish everything on NPM is already in place, thanks to `create-react-native-library`.

1. Install the dependencies in your module `yarn install`.
2. Build the library running `yarn prepare`.
3. Release it with `yarn release`.

After a while, you'll find your library on NPM. To verify that, run:

bash

```
npm view <package.name>
```

where `package.name` is the `name` you set up in the `package.json` file during the initialization of the library.

Now, you can install the library in your application by running:

bash

```
yarn add <package.name>
```

note

For iOS only, whenever you install a new module with some native code, you have to reinstall CocoaPods, by running `bundle exec pod install` (recommended) or `pod install` if you are not using Ruby's Bundler (not recommended).

Congratulations! You published your first React Native library.

## Headless JS

Headless JS is a way to run tasks in JavaScript while your app is in the background. It can be used, for example, to sync fresh data, handle push notifications, or play music.

### The JS API

A task is an async function that you register on `AppRegistry`, similar to registering React applications:

```
import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
AppRegistry.registerHeadlessTask('SomeTaskName', () =>
  require('SomeTaskName'),
);
```

Then, in `SomeTaskName.js`:

```
module.exports = async taskData => {
  // do stuff
};
```

You can do anything in your task such as network requests, timers and so on, as long as it doesn't touch UI. Once your task completes (i.e. the promise is resolved), React Native will go into "paused" mode (unless there are other tasks running, or there is a foreground app).

### The Platform API

Yes, this does still require some native code, but it's pretty thin. You need to extend `HeadlessJsTaskService` and override `getTaskConfig`, e.g.:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
package com.your_application_name;

import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.Bundle;
import com.facebook.react.HeadlessJsTaskService;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.Arguments;
import com.facebook.react.jstasks.HeadlessJsTaskConfig;
import javax.annotation.Nullable;

public class MyTaskService extends HeadlessJsTaskService {

  @Override
  protected @Nullable HeadlessJsTaskConfig getTaskConfig(Intent intent) {
    Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
    if (extras != null) {
      return new HeadlessJsTaskConfig(
          "SomeTaskName",
          Arguments.fromBundle(extras),
          5000, // timeout in milliseconds for the task
          false // optional: defines whether or not the task is allowed in foreground. Default is false
        );
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

kotlin

```
package com.your_application_name;

import android.content.Intent
import com.facebook.react.HeadlessJsTaskService
import com.facebook.react.bridge.Arguments
import com.facebook.react.jstasks.HeadlessJsTaskConfig

class MyTaskService : HeadlessJsTaskService() {
    override fun getTaskConfig(intent: Intent): HeadlessJsTaskConfig? {
        return intent.extras?.let {
            HeadlessJsTaskConfig(
                "SomeTaskName",
                Arguments.fromBundle(it),
                5000, // timeout for the task
                false // optional: defines whether or not the task is allowed in foreground.
                // Default is false
            )
        }
    }
}
```

Then add the service to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file inside the `application` tag:

xml

```
<service android:name="com.example.MyTaskService" />
```

Now, whenever you start your service, e.g. as a periodic task or in response to some system event / broadcast, JS will spin up, run your task, then spin down.

Example:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
Intent service = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), MyTaskService.class);
Bundle bundle = new Bundle();

bundle.putString("foo", "bar");
service.putExtras(bundle);

getApplicationContext().startForegroundService(service);
```

kotlin

```
val service = Intent(applicationContext, MyTaskService::class.java)
val bundle = Bundle()

bundle.putString("foo", "bar")

service.putExtras(bundle)

applicationContext.startForegroundService(service)
```

### Retries

By default, the headless JS task will not perform any retries. In order to do so, you need to create a `HeadlessJsRetryPolicy` and throw a specific `Error`.

`LinearCountingRetryPolicy` is an implementation of `HeadlessJsRetryPolicy` that allows you to specify a maximum number of retries with a fixed delay between each attempt. If that does not suit your needs then you can implement your own `HeadlessJsRetryPolicy`. These policies can be passed as an extra argument to the `HeadlessJsTaskConfig` constructor, e.g.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
HeadlessJsRetryPolicy retryPolicy = new LinearCountingRetryPolicy(
  3, // Max number of retry attempts
  1000 // Delay between each retry attempt
);

return new HeadlessJsTaskConfig(
  'SomeTaskName',
  Arguments.fromBundle(extras),
  5000,
  false,
  retryPolicy
);
```

kotlin

```
val retryPolicy: HeadlessJsTaskRetryPolicy =
    LinearCountingRetryPolicy(
        3, // Max number of retry attempts
        1000 // Delay between each retry attempt
    )

return HeadlessJsTaskConfig("SomeTaskName", Arguments.fromBundle(extras), 5000, false, retryPolicy)
```

A retry attempt will only be made when a specific `Error` is thrown. Inside a headless JS task, you can import the error and throw it when a retry attempt is required.

Example:

```
import {HeadlessJsTaskError} from 'HeadlessJsTask';

module.exports = async taskData => {
  const condition = ...;
  if (!condition) {
    throw new HeadlessJsTaskError();
  }
};
```

If you wish all errors to cause a retry attempt, you will need to catch them and throw the above error.

### Caveats

- By default, your app will crash if you try to run a task while the app is in the foreground. This is to prevent developers from shooting themselves in the foot by doing a lot of work in a task and slowing the UI. You can pass a fourth `boolean` argument to control this behaviour.
- If you start your service from a `BroadcastReceiver`, make sure to call `HeadlessJsTaskService.acquireWakeLockNow()` before returning from `onReceive()`.

### Example Usage

Service can be started from Java API. First you need to decide when the service should be started and implement your solution accordingly. Here is an example that reacts to network connection change.

Following lines shows part of Android manifest file for registering broadcast receiver.

xml

```
<receiver android:name=".NetworkChangeReceiver" >
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE" />
  </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

Broadcast receiver then handles intent that was broadcasted in onReceive function. This is a great place to check whether your app is on foreground or not. If app is not on foreground we can prepare our intent to be started, with no information or additional information bundled using `putExtra` (keep in mind bundle can handle only parcelable values). In the end service is started and wakelock is acquired.

Android requires that all apps be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed. In order to distribute your Android application via Google Play store it needs to be signed with a release key that then needs to be used for all future updates. Since 2017 it is possible for Google Play to manage signing releases automatically thanks to App Signing by Google Play functionality. However, before your application binary is uploaded to Google Play it needs to be signed with an upload key. The Signing Your Applications page on Android Developers documentation describes the topic in detail. This guide covers the process in brief, as well as lists the steps required to package the JavaScript bundle.

info

If you are using Expo, read the Expo guide for Deploying to App Stores to build and submit your app for the Google Play Store. This guide works with any React Native app to automate the deployment process.

## Generating an upload key

You can generate a private signing key using `keytool`.

#### Windows

On Windows `keytool` must be run from `C:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x_x\bin`, as administrator.

shell

```
keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore my-upload-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

This command prompts you for passwords for the keystore and key and for the Distinguished Name fields for your key. It then generates the keystore as a file called `my-upload-key.keystore`.

The keystore contains a single key, valid for 10000 days. The alias is a name that you will use later when signing your app, so remember to take note of the alias.

#### macOS

On macOS, if you're not sure where your JDK bin folder is, then perform the following command to find it:

shell

```
/usr/libexec/java_home
```

It will output the directory of the JDK, which will look something like this:

shell

```
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdkX.X.X_XXX.jdk/Contents/Home
```

Navigate to that directory by using the command `cd /your/jdk/path` and use the keytool command with sudo permission as shown below.

shell

```
sudo keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-upload-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

caution

Remember to keep the keystore file private. In case you've lost upload key or it's been compromised you should follow these instructions.

### Setting up Gradle variables

1. Place the `my-upload-key.keystore` file under the `android/app` directory in your project folder.
2. Edit the file `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or `android/gradle.properties`, and add the following (replace `*****` with the correct keystore password, alias and key password),

```
MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=my-upload-key.keystore
MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=*****
MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=*****
```

These are going to be global Gradle variables, which we can later use in our Gradle config to sign our app.

Note about using git

Saving the above Gradle variables in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` instead of `android/gradle.properties` prevents them from being checked in to git. You may have to create the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file in your user's home directory before you can add the variables.

### Adding signing config to your app's Gradle config

The last configuration step that needs to be done is to setup release builds to be signed using upload key. Edit the file `android/app/build.gradle` in your project folder, and add the signing config,

groovy

```
...
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig { ... }
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE')) {
                storeFile file(MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE)
                storePassword MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD
                keyAlias MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS
                keyPassword MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD
            }
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            ...
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
...
```

### Generating the release AAB

Run the following command in a terminal:

shell

```
npx react-native build-android --mode=release
```

This command uses Gradle's `bundleRelease` under the hood that bundles all the JavaScript needed to run your app into the AAB (Android App Bundle). If you need to change the way the JavaScript bundle and/or drawable resources are bundled (e.g. if you changed the default file/folder names or the general structure of the project), have a look at `android/app/build.gradle` to see how you can update it to reflect these changes.

note

Make sure `gradle.properties` does not include `org.gradle.configureondemand=true` as that will make the release build skip bundling JS and assets into the app binary.

The generated AAB can be found under `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`, and is ready to be uploaded to Google Play.

In order for Google Play to accept AAB format the App Signing by Google Play needs to be configured for your application on the Google Play Console. If you are updating an existing app that doesn't use App Signing by Google Play, please check our migration section to learn how to perform that configuration change.

### Testing the release build of your app

Before uploading the release build to the Play Store, make sure you test it thoroughly. First uninstall any previous version of the app you already have installed. Install it on the device using the following command in the project root:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run android -- --mode="release"
```

shell

```
yarn android --mode release
```

Note that `--mode release` is only available if you've set up signing as described above.

You can terminate any running bundler instances, since all your framework and JavaScript code is bundled in the APK's assets.

### Publishing to other stores

By default, the generated APK has the native code for both `x86`, `x86_64`, `ARMv7a` and `ARM64-v8a` CPU architectures. This makes it easier to share APKs that run on almost all Android devices. However, this has the downside that there will be some unused native code on any device, leading to unnecessarily bigger APKs.

You can create an APK for each CPU by adding the following line in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

diff

```
android {

    splits {
        abi {
            reset()
            enable true
            universalApk false
            include "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a", "x86", "x86_64"
        }
    }

}
```

Upload these files to markets which support device targeting, such as Amazon AppStore or F-Droid, and the users will automatically get the appropriate APK. If you want to upload to other markets, such as APKFiles, which do not support multiple APKs for a single app, change the `universalApk false` line to `true` to create the default universal APK with binaries for both CPUs.

Please note that you will also have to configure distinct version codes, as suggested in this page from the official Android documentation.

### Enabling Proguard to reduce the size of the APK (optional)

Proguard is a tool that can slightly reduce the size of the APK. It does this by stripping parts of the React Native Java bytecode (and its dependencies) that your app is not using.

Important

Make sure to thoroughly test your app if you've enabled Proguard. Proguard often requires configuration specific to each native library you're using. See `app/proguard-rules.pro`.

To enable Proguard, edit `android/app/build.gradle`:

groovy

```
/**
 * Run Proguard to shrink the Java bytecode in release builds.
 */
def enableProguardInReleaseBuilds = true
```

### Migrating old Android React Native apps to use App Signing by Google Play

If you are migrating from previous version of React Native chances are your app does not use App Signing by Google Play feature. We recommend you enable that in order to take advantage from things like automatic app splitting. In order to migrate from the old way of signing you need to start by generating new upload key and then replacing release signing config in `android/app/build.gradle` to use the upload key instead of the release one (see section about adding signing config to gradle). Once that's done you should follow the instructions from Google Play Help website in order to send your original release key to Google Play.

### Default Permissions

By default, `INTERNET` permission is added to your Android app as pretty much all apps use it. `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission is added to your Android APK in debug mode but it will be removed in production.

In Integrating with Existing Apps guide and Native UI Components guide we learn how to embed React Native in a native component and vice versa. When we mix native and React Native components, we'll eventually find a need to communicate between these two worlds. Some ways to achieve that have been already mentioned in other guides. This article summarizes available techniques.

## Introduction

React Native is inspired by React, so the basic idea of the information flow is similar. The flow in React is one-directional. We maintain a hierarchy of components, in which each component depends only on its parent and its own internal state. We do this with properties: data is passed from a parent to its children in a top-down manner. If an ancestor component relies on the state of its descendant, one should pass down a callback to be used by the descendant to update the ancestor.

The same concept applies to React Native. As long as we are building our application purely within the framework, we can drive our app with properties and callbacks. But, when we mix React Native and native components, we need some specific, cross-language mechanisms that would allow us to pass information between them.

### Properties

Properties are the most straightforward way of cross-component communication. So we need a way to pass properties both from native to React Native, and from React Native to native.

#### Passing properties from native to React Native

You can pass properties down to the React Native app by providing a custom implementation of `ReactActivityDelegate` in your main activity. This implementation should override `getLaunchOptions` to return a `Bundle` with the desired properties.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
  @Override
  protected ReactActivityDelegate createReactActivityDelegate() {
    return new ReactActivityDelegate(this, getMainComponentName()) {
      @Override
      protected Bundle getLaunchOptions() {
        Bundle initialProperties = new Bundle();
        ArrayList<String> imageList = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList(
                "https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ffffff/000000.png",
                "https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000000/ffffff.png"
        ));
        initialProperties.putStringArrayList("images", imageList);
        return initialProperties;
      }
    };
  }
}
```

kotlin

```
class MainActivity : ReactActivity() {
    override fun createReactActivityDelegate(): ReactActivityDelegate {
        return object : ReactActivityDelegate(this, mainComponentName) {
            override fun getLaunchOptions(): Bundle {
                val imageList = arrayListOf("https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ffffff/000000.png", "https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000000/ffffff.png")
                val initialProperties = Bundle().apply { putStringArrayList("images", imageList) }
                return initialProperties
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```
import React from 'react';
import {View, Image} from 'react-native';

export default class ImageBrowserApp extends React.Component {
  renderImage(imgURI) {
    return <Image source={{uri: imgURI}} />;
  }
  render() {
    return <View>{this.props.images.map(this.renderImage)}</View>;
  }
}
```

`ReactRootView` provides a read-write property `appProperties`. After `appProperties` is set, the React Native app is re-rendered with new properties. The update is only performed when the new updated properties differ from the previous ones.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
Bundle updatedProps = mReactRootView.getAppProperties();
ArrayList<String> imageList = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList(
        "https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ff0000/000000.png",
        "https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ffffff/ff0000.png"
));
updatedProps.putStringArrayList("images", imageList);

mReactRootView.setAppProperties(updatedProps);
```

kotlin

```
var updatedProps: Bundle = reactRootView.getAppProperties()
var imageList = arrayListOf("https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ff0000/000000.png", "https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ffffff/ff0000.png")
```

It is fine to update properties anytime. However, updates have to be performed on the main thread. You use the getter on any thread.

There is no way to update only a few properties at a time. We suggest that you build it into your own wrapper instead.

> **_Note:_** Currently, JS function `componentWillUpdateProps` of the top level RN component will not be called after a prop update. However, you can access the new props in `componentDidMount` function.

#### Passing properties from React Native to native

The problem exposing properties of native components is covered in detail in this article. In short, properties that are to be reflected in JavaScript needs to be exposed as setter method annotated with `@ReactProp`, then use them in React Native as if the component was an ordinary React Native component.

#### Limits of properties

The main drawback of cross-language properties is that they do not support callbacks, which would allow us to handle bottom-up data bindings. Imagine you have a small RN view that you want to be removed from the native parent view as a result of a JS action. There is no way to do that with props, as the information would need to go bottom-up.

Although we have a flavor of cross-language callbacks (described here), these callbacks are not always the thing we need. The main problem is that they are not intended to be passed as properties. Rather, this mechanism allows us to trigger a native action from JS, and handle the result of that action in JS.

### Other ways of cross-language interaction (events and native modules)

As stated in the previous chapter, using properties comes with some limitations. Sometimes properties are not enough to drive the logic of our app and we need a solution that gives more flexibility. This chapter covers other communication techniques available in React Native. They can be used for internal communication (between JS and native layers in RN) as well as for external communication (between RN and the 'pure native' part of your app).

React Native enables you to perform cross-language function calls. You can execute custom native code from JS and vice versa. Unfortunately, depending on the side we are working on, we achieve the same goal in different ways. For native - we use events mechanism to schedule an execution of a handler function in JS, while for React Native we directly call methods exported by native modules.

#### Calling React Native functions from native (events)

Events are described in detail in this article. Note that using events gives us no guarantees about execution time, as the event is handled on a separate thread.

Events are powerful, because they allow us to change React Native components without needing a reference to them. However, there are some pitfalls that you can fall into while using them:

- As events can be sent from anywhere, they can introduce spaghetti-style dependencies into your project.
- Events share namespace, which means that you may encounter some name collisions. Collisions will not be detected statically, which makes them hard to debug.
- If you use several instances of the same React Native component and you want to distinguish them from the perspective of your event, you'll likely need to introduce identifiers and pass them along with events (you can use the native view's `reactTag` as an identifier).

#### Calling native functions from React Native (native modules)

Native modules are Java/Kotlin classes that are available in JS. Typically one instance of each module is created per JS bridge. They can export arbitrary functions and constants to React Native. They have been covered in detail in this article.

> **_Warning_**: All native modules share the same namespace. Watch out for name collisions when creating new ones.

## Color Reference

Components in React Native are styled using JavaScript. Color properties usually match how CSS works on the web. General guides on the color usage on each platform could be found below:

-
-

### Color APIs

React Native has several color APIs designed to allow you to take full advantage of your platform's design and user preferences.

- PlatformColor lets you reference the platform's color system.
- DynamicColorIOS is iOS specific and allows you to specify which colors should be used in light or Dark Mode.

### Color representations

#### Red Green Blue (RGB)

React Native supports `rgb()` and `rgba()` in both hexadecimal and functional notation:

- `'#f0f'` (#rgb)
- `'#ff00ff'` (#rrggbb)
- `'#f0ff'` (#rgba)
- `'#ff00ff00'` (#rrggbbaa)
- `'rgb(255, 0, 255)'`
- `'rgb(255 0 255)'`
- `'rgba(255, 0, 255, 1.0)'`
- `'rgba(255 0 255 / 1.0)'`

#### Hue Saturation Lightness (HSL)

React Native supports `hsl()` and `hsla()` in functional notation:

- `'hsl(360, 100%, 100%)'`
- `'hsl(360 100% 100%)'`
- `'hsla(360, 100%, 100%, 1.0)'`
- `'hsla(360 100% 100% / 1.0)'`

#### Hue Whiteness Blackness (HWB)

React Native supports `hwb()` in functional notation:

- `'hwb(0, 0%, 100%)'`
- `'hwb(360, 100%, 100%)'`
- `'hwb(0 0% 0%)'`
- `'hwb(70 50% 0%)'`

#### Color ints

React Native supports also colors as an `int` values (in RGB color mode):

- `0xff00ff00` (0xrrggbbaa)

caution

This might appear similar to the Android Color ints representation but on Android values are stored in SRGB color mode (0xaarrggbb).

#### Named colors

In React Native you can also use color name strings as values.

info

React Native only supports lowercase color names. Uppercase color names are not supported.

##### `transparent`

This is a shortcut for `rgba(0,0,0,0)`, same like in CSS3.

## React Native Gradle Plugin

This guide describes how to configure the **React Native Gradle Plugin** (often referred as RNGP), when building your React Native application for Android.

### Using the plugin

The React Native Gradle Plugin is distributed as a separate NPM package which is installed automatically with `react-native`.

The plugin is **already configured** for new projects created using `npx react-native init`. You don't need to do any extra steps to install it if you created your app with this command.

If you're integrating React Native into an existing project, please refer to the corresponding page: it contains specific instructions on how to install the plugin.

### Configuring the plugin

By default, the plugin will work **out of the box** with sensible defaults. You should refer to this guide and customize the behavior only if you need it.

To configure the plugin you can modify the `react` block, inside your `android/app/build.gradle`:

groovy

```
apply plugin: "com.facebook.react"

/**
 * This is the configuration block to customize your React Native Android app.
 * By default you don't need to apply any configuration, just uncomment the lines you need.
 */
react {
  // Custom configuration goes here.
}
```

Each configuration key is described below:

#### `root`

This is the root folder of your React Native project, i.e. where the `package.json` file lives. Default is `..`. You can customize it as follows:

groovy

```
root = file("../")
```

#### `reactNativeDir`

This is the folder where the `react-native` package lives. Default is `../node_modules/react-native`. If you're in a monorepo or using a different package manager, you can use adjust `reactNativeDir` to your setup.

You can customize it as follows:

groovy

```
reactNativeDir = file("../node_modules/react-native")
```

#### `codegenDir`

This is the folder where the `react-native-codegen` package lives. Default is `../node_modules/react-native-codegen`. If you're in a monorepo or using a different package manager, you can adjust `codegenDir` to your setup.

You can customize it as follows:

groovy

```
codegenDir = file("../node_modules/@react-native/codegen")
```

#### `cliFile`

This is the entrypoint file for the React Native CLI. Default is `../node_modules/react-native/cli.js`. The entrypoint file is needed as the plugin needs to invoke the CLI for bundling and creating your app.

If you're in a monorepo or using a different package manager, you can adjust `cliFile` to your setup. You can customize it as follows:

groovy

```
cliFile = file("../node_modules/react-native/cli.js")
```

#### `debuggableVariants`

This is the list of variants that are debuggable (see using variants for more context on variants).

By default the plugin is considering as `debuggableVariants` only `debug`, while `release` is not. If you have other variants (like `staging`, `lite`, etc.) you'll need to adjust this accordingly.

Variants that are listed as `debuggableVariants` will not come with a shipped bundle, so you'll need Metro to run them.

You can customize it as follows:

groovy

```
debuggableVariants = ["liteDebug", "prodDebug"]
```

#### `nodeExecutableAndArgs`

This is the list of node command and arguments that should be invoked for all the scripts. By default is `[node]` but can be customized to add extra flags as follows:

groovy

```
nodeExecutableAndArgs = ["node"]
```

#### `bundleCommand`

This is the name of the `bundle` command to be invoked when creating the bundle for your app. That's useful if you're using RAM Bundles. By default is `bundle` but can be customized to add extra flags as follows:

groovy

```
bundleCommand = "ram-bundle"
```

#### `bundleConfig`

This is the path to a configuration file that will be passed to `bundle --config <file>` if provided. Default is empty (no config file will be probided). More information on bundling config files can be found on the CLI documentation. Can be customized as follow:

groovy

```
bundleConfig = file(../rn-cli.config.js)
```

#### `bundleAssetName`

This is the name of the bundle file that should be generated. Default is `index.android.bundle`. Can be customized as follow:

groovy

```
bundleAssetName = "MyApplication.android.bundle"
```

#### `entryFile`

The entry file used for bundle generation. The default is to search for `index.android.js` or `index.js`. Can be customized as follow:

groovy

```
entryFile = file("../js/MyApplication.android.js")
```

#### `extraPackagerArgs`

A list of extra flags that will be passed to the `bundle` command. The list of available flags is in the CLI documentation. Default is empty. Can be customized as follows:

groovy

```
extraPackagerArgs = []
```

#### `hermesCommand`

The path to the `hermesc` command (the Hermes Compiler). React Native comes with a version of the Hermes compiler bundled with it, so you generally won't be needing to customize this. The plugin will use the correct compiler for your system by default.

#### `hermesFlags`

The list of flags to pass to `hermesc`. By default is `["-O", "-output-source-map"]`. You can customize it as follows

groovy

```
hermesFlags = ["-O", "-output-source-map"]
```

#### `enableBundleCompression`

Whether the Bundle Asset should be compressed when packaged into a `.apk`, or not.

Disabling compression for the `.bundle` allows it to be directly memory-mapped to RAM, hence improving startup time - at the cost of a larger resulting app size on disk. Please note that the `.apk` download size will be mostly unaffected as the `.apk` files are compressed before downloading

By default this is disabled, and you should not turn it on, unless you're really concerned about disk space for your application.

### Using Flavors & Build Variants

When building Android apps, you might want to use custom flavors to have different versions of your app starting from the same project.

Please refer to the official Android guide to configure custom build types (like `staging`) or custom flavors (like `full`, `lite`, etc.). By default new apps are created with two build types (`debug` and `release`) and no custom flavors.

The combination of all the build types and all the flavors generates a set of **build variants**. For instance for `debug`/`staging`/`release` build types and `full`/`lite` you will have 6 build variants: `fullDebug`, `fullStaging`, `fullRelease` and so on.

If you're using custom variants beyond `debug` and `release`, you need to instruct the React Native Gradle Plugin specifying which of your variants are **debuggable** using the `debuggableVariants` configuration as follows:

diff

```
apply plugin: "com.facebook.react"

react {
+ debuggableVariants = ["fullStaging", "fullDebug"]
}
```

This is necessary because the plugin will skip the JS bundling for all the `debuggableVariants`: you'll need Metro to run them. For example, if you list `fullStaging` in the `debuggableVariants`, you won't be able to publish it to a store as it will be missing the bundle.

### What is the plugin doing under the hood?

The React Native Gradle Plugin is responsible for configuring your Application build to ship React Native applications to production. The plugin is also used inside 3rd party libraries, to run the Codegen used for the New Architecture.

Here is a summary of the plugin responsibilities:

- Add a `createBundle<Variant>JsAndAssets` task for every non debuggable variant, that is responsible of invoking the `bundle`, `hermesc` and `compose-source-map` commands.
- Setting up the proper version of the `com.facebook.react:react-android` and `com.facebook.react:hermes-android` dependency, reading the React Native version from the `package.json` of `react-native`.
- Setting up the proper Maven repositories (Maven Central, Google Maven Repo, JSC local Maven repo, etc.) needed to consume all the necessary Maven Dependencies.
- Setting up the NDK to let you build apps that are using the New Architecture.
- Setting up the `buildConfigFields` so that you can know at runtime if Hermes or the New Architecture are enabled.
- Setting up the Metro DevServer Port as an Android resource so the app knows on which port to connect.
- Invoking the React Native Codegen if a library or app is using the Codegen for the New Architecture.

## Linking Libraries

Not every app uses all the native capabilities, and including the code to support all those features would impact the binary size... But we still want to support adding these features whenever you need them.

With that in mind we exposed many of these features as independent static libraries.

For most of the libs it will be as quick as dragging two files, sometimes a third step will be necessary, but no more than that.

note

All the libraries we ship with React Native live in the `Libraries` folder in the root of the repository. Some of them are pure JavaScript, and you only need to `require` it. Other libraries also rely on some native code, in that case you'll have to add these files to your app, otherwise the app will throw an error as soon as you try to use the library.

### Here are the few steps to link your libraries that contain native code

#### Automatic linking

Install a library with native dependencies:

shell

```
npm install <library-with-native-dependencies> --save
```

info

`--save` or `--save-dev` flag is very important for this step. React Native will link your libs based on `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in your `package.json` file.

That's it! Next time you build your app the native code will be linked thanks to the autolinking mechanism.

#### Manual linking

##### Step 1

If the library has native code, there must be an `.xcodeproj` file inside its folder. Drag this file to your project on Xcode (usually under the `Libraries` group on Xcode);

##### Step 2

Click on your main project file (the one that represents the `.xcodeproj`) select `Build Phases` and drag the static library from the `Products` folder inside the Library you are importing to `Link Binary With Libraries`

##### Step 3

Not every library will need this step, what you need to consider is:

_Do I need to know the contents of the library at compile time?_

What that means is, are you using this library on the native side or only in JavaScript? If you are only using it in JavaScript, you are good to go!

If you do need to call it from native, then we need to know the library's headers. To achieve that you have to go to your project's file, select `Build Settings` and search for `Header Search Paths`. There you should include the path to your library. (This documentation used to recommend using `recursive`, but this is no longer recommended, as it can cause subtle build failures, especially with CocoaPods.)

## Running On Simulator

### Starting the simulator

Once you have your React Native project initialized, you can run the following command inside the newly created project directory.

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run ios
```

shell

```
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the iOS Simulator shortly.

### Specifying a device

You can specify the device the simulator should run with the `--simulator` flag, followed by the device name as a string. The default is `"iPhone 14"`. If you wish to run your app on an iPhone SE (3rd generation), run the following command:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run ios -- --simulator="iPhone SE (3rd generation)"
```

shell

```
yarn ios --simulator "iPhone SE (3rd generation)"
```

The device names correspond to the list of devices available in Xcode. You can check your available devices by running `xcrun simctl list devices` from the console.

#### Specifying a version of device

If you have multiple iOS versions installed, you also need to specify its appropriate version. E.g. To run your app on an iPhone 14 Pro (16.0) run the following command:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run ios -- --simulator="iPhone 14 Pro (16.0)"
```

shell

```
yarn ios --simulator "iPhone 14 Pro (16.0)"
```

### Specifying an UDID

You can specify the device UDID returned from `xcrun simctl list devices` command. E.g. To run your app with UDID `AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA` run the following command:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run ios -- --udid="AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
```

shell

```
yarn ios --udid "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
```

In Integrating with Existing Apps guide and Native UI Components guide we learn how to embed React Native in a native component and vice versa. When we mix native and React Native components, we'll eventually find a need to communicate between these two worlds. Some ways to achieve that have been already mentioned in other guides. This article summarizes available techniques.

## Introduction

React Native is inspired by React, so the basic idea of the information flow is similar. The flow in React is one-directional. We maintain a hierarchy of components, in which each component depends only on its parent and its own internal state. We do this with properties: data is passed from a parent to its children in a top-down manner. If an ancestor component relies on the state of its descendant, one should pass down a callback to be used by the descendant to update the ancestor.

The same concept applies to React Native. As long as we are building our application purely within the framework, we can drive our app with properties and callbacks. But, when we mix React Native and native components, we need some specific, cross-language mechanisms that would allow us to pass information between them.

### Properties

Properties are the most straightforward way of cross-component communication. So we need a way to pass properties both from native to React Native, and from React Native to native.

#### Passing properties from native to React Native

In order to embed a React Native view in a native component, we use `RCTRootView`. `RCTRootView` is a `UIView` that holds a React Native app. It also provides an interface between native side and the hosted app.

`RCTRootView` has an initializer that allows you to pass arbitrary properties down to the React Native app. The `initialProperties` parameter has to be an instance of `NSDictionary`. The dictionary is internally converted into a JSON object that the top-level JS component can reference.

objectivec

```
NSArray *imageList = @[@"https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ffffff/000000.png",
                       @"https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000000/ffffff.png"];

NSDictionary *props = @{@"images" : imageList};

RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge
                                                 moduleName:@"ImageBrowserApp"
                                          initialProperties:props];
```

```
import React from 'react';
import {View, Image} from 'react-native';

export default class ImageBrowserApp extends React.Component {
  renderImage(imgURI) {
    return <Image source={{uri: imgURI}} />;
  }
  render() {
    return <View>{this.props.images.map(this.renderImage)}</View>;
  }
}
```

`RCTRootView` also provides a read-write property `appProperties`. After `appProperties` is set, the React Native app is re-rendered with new properties. The update is only performed when the new updated properties differ from the previous ones.

objectivec

```
NSArray *imageList = @[@"https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ff0000/000000.png",
                       @"https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ffffff/ff0000.png"];

rootView.appProperties = @{@"images" : imageList};
```

It is fine to update properties anytime. However, updates have to be performed on the main thread. You use the getter on any thread.

note

There is no way to update only a few properties at a time. We suggest that you build it into your own wrapper instead.

#### Passing properties from React Native to native

The problem exposing properties of native components is covered in detail in this article. In short, export properties with `RCT_CUSTOM_VIEW_PROPERTY` macro in your custom native component, then use them in React Native as if the component was an ordinary React Native component.

#### Limits of properties

The main drawback of cross-language properties is that they do not support callbacks, which would allow us to handle bottom-up data bindings. Imagine you have a small RN view that you want to be removed from the native parent view as a result of a JS action. There is no way to do that with props, as the information would need to go bottom-up.

Although we have a flavor of cross-language callbacks (described here), these callbacks are not always the thing we need. The main problem is that they are not intended to be passed as properties. Rather, this mechanism allows us to trigger a native action from JS, and handle the result of that action in JS.

### Other ways of cross-language interaction (events and native modules)

As stated in the previous chapter, using properties comes with some limitations. Sometimes properties are not enough to drive the logic of our app and we need a solution that gives more flexibility. This chapter covers other communication techniques available in React Native. They can be used for internal communication (between JS and native layers in RN) as well as for external communication (between RN and the 'pure native' part of your app).

React Native enables you to perform cross-language function calls. You can execute custom native code from JS and vice versa. Unfortunately, depending on the side we are working on, we achieve the same goal in different ways. For native - we use events mechanism to schedule an execution of a handler function in JS, while for React Native we directly call methods exported by native modules.

#### Calling React Native functions from native (events)

Events are described in detail in this article. Note that using events gives us no guarantees about execution time, as the event is handled on a separate thread.

Events are powerful, because they allow us to change React Native components without needing a reference to them. However, there are some pitfalls that you can fall into while using them:

- As events can be sent from anywhere, they can introduce spaghetti-style dependencies into your project.
- Events share namespace, which means that you may encounter some name collisions. Collisions will not be detected statically, which makes them hard to debug.
- If you use several instances of the same React Native component and you want to distinguish them from the perspective of your event, you'll likely need to introduce identifiers and pass them along with events (you can use the native view's `reactTag` as an identifier).

The common pattern we use when embedding native in React Native is to make the native component's RCTViewManager a delegate for the views, sending events back to JavaScript via the bridge. This keeps related event calls in one place.

#### Calling native functions from React Native (native modules)

Native modules are Objective-C classes that are available in JS. Typically one instance of each module is created per JS bridge. They can export arbitrary functions and constants to React Native. They have been covered in detail in this article.

The fact that native modules are singletons limits the mechanism in the context of embedding. Let's say we have a React Native component embedded in a native view and we want to update the native, parent view. Using the native module mechanism, we would export a function that not only takes expected arguments, but also an identifier of the parent native view. The identifier would be used to retrieve a reference to the parent view to update. That said, we would need to keep a mapping from identifiers to native views in the module.

Although this solution is complex, it is used in `RCTUIManager`, which is an internal React Native class that manages all React Native views.

Native modules can also be used to expose existing native libraries to JS. The Geolocation library is a living example of the idea.

caution

All native modules share the same namespace. Watch out for name collisions when creating new ones.

### Layout computation flow

When integrating native and React Native, we also need a way to consolidate two different layout systems. This section covers common layout problems and provides a brief description of mechanisms to address them.

#### Layout of a native component embedded in React Native

This case is covered in this article. To summarize, since all our native react views are subclasses of `UIView`, most style and size attributes will work like you would expect out of the box.

#### Layout of a React Native component embedded in native

##### React Native content with fixed size

The general scenario is when we have a React Native app with a fixed size, which is known to the native side. In particular, a full-screen React Native view falls into this case. If we want a smaller root view, we can explicitly set RCTRootView's frame.

For instance, to make an RN app 200 (logical) pixels high, and the hosting view's width wide, we could do:

SomeViewController.m

```
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
  [...]
  RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge
                                                   moduleName:appName
                                            initialProperties:props];
  rootView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.width, 200);
  [self.view addSubview:rootView];
}
```

When we have a fixed size root view, we need to respect its bounds on the JS side. In other words, we need to ensure that the React Native content can be contained within the fixed-size root view. The easiest way to ensure this is to use Flexbox layout. If you use absolute positioning, and React components are visible outside the root view's bounds, you'll get overlap with native views, causing some features to behave unexpectedly. For instance, 'TouchableHighlight' will not highlight your touches outside the root view's bounds.

It's totally fine to update root view's size dynamically by re-setting its frame property. React Native will take care of the content's layout.

##### React Native content with flexible size

In some cases we'd like to render content of initially unknown size. Let's say the size will be defined dynamically in JS. We have two solutions to this problem.

1. You can wrap your React Native view in a `ScrollView` component. This guarantees that your content will always be available and it won't overlap with native views.
2. React Native allows you to determine, in JS, the size of the RN app and provide it to the owner of the hosting `RCTRootView`. The owner is then responsible for re-laying out the subviews and keeping the UI consistent. We achieve this with `RCTRootView`'s flexibility modes.

`RCTRootView` supports 4 different size flexibility modes:

RCTRootView\.h

```
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, RCTRootViewSizeFlexibility) {
  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityNone = 0,
  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityWidth,
  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight,
  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityWidthAndHeight,
};
```

`RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityNone` is the default value, which makes a root view's size fixed (but it still can be updated with `setFrame:`). The other three modes allow us to track React Native content's size updates. For instance, setting mode to `RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight` will cause React Native to measure the content's height and pass that information back to `RCTRootView`'s delegate. An arbitrary action can be performed within the delegate, including setting the root view's frame, so the content fits. The delegate is called only when the size of the content has changed.

caution

Making a dimension flexible in both JS and native leads to undefined behavior. For example - don't make a top-level React component's width flexible (with `flexbox`) while you're using `RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityWidth` on the hosting `RCTRootView`.

Let's look at an example.

FlexibleSizeExampleView\.m

```
- (instancetype)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame
{
  [...]

  _rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge
  moduleName:@"FlexibilityExampleApp"
  initialProperties:@{}];

  _rootView.delegate = self;
  _rootView.sizeFlexibility = RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight;
  _rootView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, 0);
}

#pragma mark - RCTRootViewDelegate
- (void)rootViewDidChangeIntrinsicSize:(RCTRootView *)rootView
{
  CGRect newFrame = rootView.frame;
  newFrame.size = rootView.intrinsicContentSize;

  rootView.frame = newFrame;
}
```

In the example we have a `FlexibleSizeExampleView` view that holds a root view. We create the root view, initialize it and set the delegate. The delegate will handle size updates. Then, we set the root view's size flexibility to `RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight`, which means that `rootViewDidChangeIntrinsicSize:` method will be called every time the React Native content changes its height. Finally, we set the root view's width and position. Note that we set there height as well, but it has no effect as we made the height RN-dependent.

You can checkout full source code of the example here.

It's fine to change root view's size flexibility mode dynamically. Changing flexibility mode of a root view will schedule a layout recalculation and the delegate `rootViewDidChangeIntrinsicSize:` method will be called once the content size is known.

note

React Native layout calculation is performed on a separate thread, while native UI view updates are done on the main thread. This may cause temporary UI inconsistencies between native and React Native. This is a known problem and our team is working on synchronizing UI updates coming from different sources.

note

React Native does not perform any layout calculations until the root view becomes a subview of some other views. If you want to hide React Native view until its dimensions are known, add the root view as a subview and make it initially hidden (use `UIView`'s `hidden` property). Then change its visibility in the delegate method.

## App Extensions

App extensions let you provide custom functionality and content outside of your main app. There are different types of app extensions on iOS, and they are all covered in the App Extension Programming Guide. In this guide, we'll briefly cover how you may take advantage of app extensions on iOS.

### Memory use in extensions

As these extensions are loaded outside of the regular app sandbox, it's highly likely that several of these app extensions will be loaded simultaneously. As you might expect, these extensions have small memory usage limits. Keep these in mind when developing your app extensions. It's always highly recommended to test your application on an actual device, and more so when developing app extensions: too frequently, developers find that their extension works fine in the iOS Simulator, only to get user reports that their extension is not loading on actual devices.

We highly recommend that you watch Conrad Kramer's talk on Memory Use in Extensions to learn more about this topic.

#### Today widget

The memory limit of a Today widget is 16 MB. As it happens, Today widget implementations using React Native may work unreliably because the memory usage tends to be too high. You can tell if your Today widget is exceeding the memory limit if it yields the message 'Unable to Load':

Always make sure to test your app extensions in a real device, but be aware that this may not be sufficient, especially when dealing with Today widgets. Debug-configured builds are more likely to exceed the memory limits, while release-configured builds don't fail right away. We highly recommend that you use Xcode's Instruments to analyze your real world memory usage, as it's very likely that your release-configured build is very close to the 16 MB limit. In situations like these, you can quickly go over the 16 MB limit by performing common operations, such as fetching data from an API.

To experiment with the limits of React Native Today widget implementations, try extending the example project in react-native-today-widget.

#### Other app extensions

Other types of app extensions have greater memory limits than the Today widget. For instance, Custom Keyboard extensions are limited to 48 MB, and Share extensions are limited to 120 MB. Implementing such app extensions with React Native is more viable. One proof of concept example is react-native-ios-share-extension.

The publishing process is the same as any other native iOS app, with some additional considerations to take into account.

info

If you are using Expo, read the Expo guide for Deploying to App Stores to build and submit your app for the Apple App Store. This guide works with any React Native app to automate the deployment process.

## 1. Configure release scheme

Building an app for distribution in the App Store requires using the `Release` scheme in Xcode. Apps built for `Release` will automatically disable the in-app Dev Menu, which will prevent your users from inadvertently accessing the menu in production. It will also bundle the JavaScript locally, so you can put the app on a device and test whilst not connected to the computer.

To configure your app to be built using the `Release` scheme, go to **Product** → **Scheme** → **Edit Scheme**. Select the **Run** tab in the sidebar, then set the Build Configuration dropdown to `Release`.

##### Pro Tips

As your App Bundle grows in size, you may start to see a blank screen flash between your splash screen and the display of your root application view. If this is the case, you can add the following code to `AppDelegate.m` in order to keep your splash screen displayed during the transition.

objectivec

```
  // Place this code after "[self.window makeKeyAndVisible]" and before "return YES;"
  UIStoryboard *sb = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"LaunchScreen" bundle:nil];
  UIViewController *vc = [sb instantiateInitialViewController];
  rootView.loadingView = vc.view;
```

The static bundle is built every time you target a physical device, even in Debug. If you want to save time, turn off bundle generation in Debug by adding the following to your shell script in the Xcode Build Phase `Bundle React Native code and images`:

shell

```
 if [ "${CONFIGURATION}" == "Debug" ]; then
  export SKIP_BUNDLING=true
 fi
```

#### 2. Build app for release

You can now build your app for release by tapping `Cmd ⌘` + `B` or selecting **Product** → **Build** from the menu bar. Once built for release, you'll be able to distribute the app to beta testers and submit the app to the App Store.

info

You can also use the `React Native CLI` to perform this operation using the option `--mode` with the value `Release` (e.g. from the root of your project: `npm run ios -- --mode="Release"` or `yarn ios --mode Release`).

Once you are done with the testing and ready to publish to App Store, follow along with this guide.

- Launch your terminal, and navigate into the iOS folder of your app and type `open .`.
- Double click on YOUR_APP_NAME.xcworkspace. It should launch XCode.
- Click on `Product` → `Archive`. Make sure to set the device to "Any iOS Device (arm64)".

note

Check your Bundle Identifier and make sure it is exactly same as the one you have created in the Identifiers in Apple Developer Dashboard.

- After the archive is completed, in the archive window, click on `Distribute App`.
- Click on `App Store Connect` now (if you want to publish in App Store).
- Click `Upload` → Make sure all the check boxes are selected, hit `Next`.
- Choose between `Automatically manage signing` and `Manually manage signing` based on your needs.
- Click on `Upload`.
- Now you can find it in the App Store Connect under TestFlight.

Now fill up the necessary information and in the Build Section, select the build of the app and click on `Save` → `Submit For Review`.

#### 4. Screenshots

The Apple Store requires you have screenshots for the latest devices. The reference for such devices would be found here. Note that screenshots for some display sizes are not required if they are provided for other sizes.

## PanResponder

`PanResponder` reconciles several touches into a single gesture. It makes single-touch gestures resilient to extra touches, and can be used to recognize basic multi-touch gestures.

By default, `PanResponder` holds an `InteractionManager` handle to block long-running JS events from interrupting active gestures.

It provides a predictable wrapper of the responder handlers provided by the gesture responder system. For each handler, it provides a new `gestureState` object alongside the native event object:

```
onPanResponderMove: (event, gestureState) => {}
```

A native event is a synthetic touch event with form of PressEvent.

A `gestureState` object has the following:

- `stateID` - ID of the gestureState- persisted as long as there's at least one touch on screen
- `moveX` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch
- `moveY` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch
- `x0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant
- `y0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant
- `dx` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started
- `dy` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started
- `vx` - current velocity of the gesture
- `vy` - current velocity of the gesture
- `numberActiveTouches` - Number of touches currently on screen

### Usage Pattern

```
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const panResponder = React.useRef(
    PanResponder.create({
      // Ask to be the responder:
      onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,
      onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) =>
        true,
      onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,
      onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) =>
        true,

      onPanResponderGrant: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // The gesture has started. Show visual feedback so the user knows
        // what is happening!
        // gestureState.d{x,y} will be set to zero now
      },
      onPanResponderMove: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // The most recent move distance is gestureState.move{X,Y}
        // The accumulated gesture distance since becoming responder is
        // gestureState.d{x,y}
      },
      onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (evt, gestureState) =>
        true,
      onPanResponderRelease: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // The user has released all touches while this view is the
        // responder. This typically means a gesture has succeeded
      },
      onPanResponderTerminate: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // Another component has become the responder, so this gesture
        // should be cancelled
      },
      onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // Returns whether this component should block native components from becoming the JS
        // responder. Returns true by default. Is currently only supported on android.
        return true;
      },
    }),
  ).current;

  return <View {...panResponder.panHandlers} />;
};
```

### Example

`PanResponder` works with `Animated` API to help build complex gestures in the UI. The following example contains an animated `View` component which can be dragged freely across the screen

Try the PanResponder example in RNTester.

### Reference

### Methods

#### `create()`

```
static create(config: PanResponderCallbacks): PanResponderInstance;
```

**Parameters:**

| Name           | Type   | Description |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| configRequired | object | Refer below |

The `config` object provides enhanced versions of all of the responder callbacks that provide not only the `PressEvent`, but also the `PanResponder` gesture state, by replacing the word `Responder` with `PanResponder` in each of the typical `onResponder*` callbacks. For example, the `config` object would look like:

- `onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderReject: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderGrant: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderStart: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderEnd: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderRelease: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderMove: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderTerminate: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`

In general, for events that have capture equivalents, we update the gestureState once in the capture phase and can use it in the bubble phase as well.

Be careful with `onStartShould*` callbacks. They only reflect updated `gestureState` for start/end events that bubble/capture to the Node. Once the node is the responder, you can rely on every start/end event being processed by the gesture and `gestureState` being updated accordingly. (numberActiveTouches) may not be totally accurate unless you are the responder.

## Installing dependencies

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.

#### Node & Watchman

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

shell

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
```

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 18.18 or newer.

Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

#### Java Development Kit

We recommend installing the OpenJDK distribution called Azul **Zulu** using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

shell

```
brew install --cask zulu@17

# Get path to where cask was installed to find the JDK installer
brew info --cask zulu@17

# ==> zulu@17: <version number>
# https://www.azul.com/downloads/
# Installed
# /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/zulu@17/<version number> (185.8MB) (note that the path is /usr/local/Caskroom on non-Apple Silicon Macs)
# Installed using the formulae.brew.sh API on 2024-06-06 at 10:00:00

# Navigate to the folder
open /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/zulu@17/<version number> # or /usr/local/Caskroom/zulu@17/<version number>
```

After opening Finder, double click the `Double-Click to Install Azul Zulu JDK 17.pkg` package to install the JDK.

After the JDK installation, add or update your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in `~/.zshrc` (or in `~/.bash_profile`).

If you used above steps, JDK will likely be located at `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home`:

shell

```
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home
```

The Zulu OpenJDK distribution offers JDKs for **both Intel and M1 Macs**. This will make sure your builds are faster on M1 Macs compared to using an Intel-based JDK.

If you have already installed JDK on your system, we recommend JDK 17. You may encounter problems using higher JDK versions.

#### Android development environment

Setting up your development environment can be somewhat tedious if you're new to Android development. If you're already familiar with Android development, there are a few things you may need to configure. In either case, please make sure to carefully follow the next few steps.

##### 1. Install Android Studio

Download and install Android Studio. While on Android Studio installation wizard, make sure the boxes next to all of the following items are checked:

- `Android SDK`
- `Android SDK Platform`
- `Android Virtual Device`

Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.

> If the checkboxes are grayed out, you will have a chance to install these components later on.

Once setup has finalized and you're presented with the Welcome screen, proceed to the next step.

##### 2. Install the Android SDK

Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the `Android 15 (VanillaIceCream)` SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.

To do that, open Android Studio, click on "More Actions" button and select "SDK Manager".

> The SDK Manager can also be found within the Android Studio "Settings" dialog, under **Languages & Frameworks** → **Android SDK**.

Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the `Android 15 (VanillaIceCream)` entry, then make sure the following items are checked:

- `Android SDK Platform 35`
- `Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image` or `Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image` or (for Apple M1 Silicon) `Google APIs ARM 64 v8a System Image`

Next, select the "SDK Tools" tab and check the box next to "Show Package Details" here as well. Look for and expand the "Android SDK Build-Tools" entry, then make sure that `35.0.0` is selected.

Finally, click "Apply" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.

##### 3. Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable

The React Native tools require some environment variables to be set up in order to build apps with native code.

Add the following lines to your `~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc` (if you are using `bash`, then `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`) config file:

shell

```
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Run `source ~/.zprofile` (or `source ~/.bash_profile` for `bash`) to load the config into your current shell. Verify that ANDROID_HOME has been set by running `echo $ANDROID_HOME` and the appropriate directories have been added to your path by running `echo $PATH`.

> Please make sure you use the correct Android SDK path. You can find the actual location of the SDK in the Android Studio "Settings" dialog, under **Languages & Frameworks** → **Android SDK**.

### Preparing the Android device

You will need an Android device to run your React Native Android app. This can be either a physical Android device, or more commonly, you can use an Android Virtual Device which allows you to emulate an Android device on your computer.

Either way, you will need to prepare the device to run Android apps for development.

#### Using a physical device

If you have a physical Android device, you can use it for development in place of an AVD by plugging it in to your computer using a USB cable and following the instructions here.

#### Using a virtual device

If you use Android Studio to open `./AwesomeProject/android`, you can see the list of available Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) by opening the "AVD Manager" from within Android Studio. Look for an icon that looks like this:

If you have recently installed Android Studio, you will likely need to create a new AVD. Select "Create Virtual Device...", then pick any Phone from the list and click "Next", then select the **VanillaIceCream** API Level 35 image.

Click "Next" then "Finish" to create your AVD. At this point you should be able to click on the green triangle button next to your AVD to launch it.

#### That's it!

Congratulations! You successfully set up your development environment.

### Now what?

- If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the Integration guide.
- If you're curious to learn more about React Native, check out the Introduction to React Native.

### Installing dependencies

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, Xcode and CocoaPods.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Xcode in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for iOS.

#### Node & Watchman

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

shell

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
```

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 18.18 or newer.

Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

#### Xcode

Please use the **latest version** of Xcode.

The easiest way to install Xcode is via the Mac App Store. Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

##### Command Line Tools

You will also need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Open Xcode, then choose **Settings... (or Preferences...)** from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.

##### Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode

To install a simulator, open **Xcode > Settings... (or Preferences...)** and select the **Platforms (or Components)** tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.

If you are using Xcode version 14.0 or greater to install a simulator, open **Xcode > Settings > Platforms** tab, then click "+" icon and select **iOS…** option.

##### CocoaPods

CocoaPods is one of the dependency management system available for iOS. CocoaPods is a Ruby gem. You can install CocoaPods using the version of Ruby that ships with the latest version of macOS.

For more information, please visit CocoaPods Getting Started guide.

#### \[Optional] Configuring your environment

Starting from React Native version 0.69, it is possible to configure the Xcode environment using the `.xcode.env` file provided by the template.

The `.xcode.env` file contains an environment variable to export the path to the `node` executable in the `NODE_BINARY` variable. This is the **suggested approach** to decouple the build infrastructure from the system version of `node`. You should customize this variable with your own path or your own `node` version manager, if it differs from the default.

On top of this, it's possible to add any other environment variable and to source the `.xcode.env` file in your build script phases. If you need to run script that requires some specific environment, this is the **suggested approach**: it allows to decouple the build phases from a specific environment.

info

If you are already using NVM (a command which helps you install and switch between versions of Node.js) and zsh, you might want to move the code that initialize NVM from your `~/.zshrc` into a `~/.zshenv` file to help Xcode find your Node executable:

zsh

```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
```

You might also want to ensure that all "shell script build phase" of your Xcode project, is using `/bin/zsh` as its shell.

#### That's it!

Congratulations! You successfully set up your development environment.

## Android Native Modules

info

Native Module and Native Components are our stable technologies used by the legacy architecture. They will be deprecated in the future when the New Architecture will be stable. The New Architecture uses Turbo Native Module and Fabric Native Components to achieve similar results.

Welcome to Native Modules for Android. Please start by reading the Native Modules Intro for an intro to what native modules are.

### Create a Calendar Native Module

In the following guide you will create a native module, `CalendarModule`, that will allow you to access Android’s calendar APIs from JavaScript. By the end, you will be able to call `CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent('Dinner Party', 'My House');` from JavaScript, invoking a Java/Kotlin method that creates a calendar event.

#### Setup

To get started, open up the Android project within your React Native application in Android Studio. You can find your Android project here within a React Native app:

Image of where you can find your Android project

We recommend using Android Studio to write your native code. Android studio is an IDE built for Android development and using it will help you resolve minor issues like code syntax errors quickly.

We also recommend enabling Gradle Daemon to speed up builds as you iterate on Java/Kotlin code.

#### Create A Custom Native Module File

The first step is to create the (`CalendarModule.java` or `CalendarModule.kt`) Java/Kotlin file inside `android/app/src/main/java/com/your-app-name/` folder (the folder is the same for both Kotlin and Java). This Java/Kotlin file will contain your native module Java/Kotlin class.

Image of how to add the CalendarModuleClass

Then add the following content:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
package com.your-apps-package-name; // replace your-apps-package-name with your app’s package name
import com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContext;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContextBaseJavaModule;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactMethod;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class CalendarModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {
   CalendarModule(ReactApplicationContext context) {
       super(context);
   }
}
```

kotlin

```
package com.your-apps-package-name; // replace your-apps-package-name with your app’s package name
import com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContext
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContextBaseJavaModule
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactMethod

class CalendarModule(reactContext: ReactApplicationContext) : ReactContextBaseJavaModule(reactContext) {...}
```

As you can see, your `CalendarModule` class extends the `ReactContextBaseJavaModule` class. For Android, Java/Kotlin native modules are written as classes that extend `ReactContextBaseJavaModule` and implement the functionality required by JavaScript.

> It is worth noting that technically Java/Kotlin classes only need to extend the `BaseJavaModule` class or implement the `NativeModule` interface to be considered a Native Module by React Native.

> However we recommend that you use `ReactContextBaseJavaModule`, as shown above. `ReactContextBaseJavaModule` gives access to the `ReactApplicationContext` (RAC), which is useful for Native Modules that need to hook into activity lifecycle methods. Using `ReactContextBaseJavaModule` will also make it easier to make your native module type-safe in the future. For native module type-safety, which is coming in future releases, React Native looks at each native module's JavaScript spec and generates an abstract base class that extends `ReactContextBaseJavaModule`.

#### Module Name

All Java/Kotlin native modules in Android need to implement the `getName()` method. This method returns a string, which represents the name of the native module. The native module can then be accessed in JavaScript using its name. For example, in the below code snippet, `getName()` returns `"CalendarModule"`.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
// add to CalendarModule.java
@Override
public String getName() {
   return "CalendarModule";
}
```

kotlin

```
// add to CalendarModule.kt
override fun getName() = "CalendarModule"
```

The native module can then be accessed in JS like this:

```
const {CalendarModule} = ReactNative.NativeModules;
```

#### Export a Native Method to JavaScript

Next you will need to add a method to your native module that will create calendar events and can be invoked in JavaScript. All native module methods meant to be invoked from JavaScript must be annotated with `@ReactMethod`.

Set up a method `createCalendarEvent()` for `CalendarModule` that can be invoked in JS through `CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent()`. For now, the method will take in a name and location as strings. Argument type options will be covered shortly.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
@ReactMethod
public void createCalendarEvent(String name, String location) {
}
```

kotlin

```
@ReactMethod fun createCalendarEvent(name: String, location: String) {}
```

Add a debug log in the method to confirm it has been invoked when you call it from your application. Below is an example of how you can import and use the Log class from the Android util package:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
import android.util.Log;

@ReactMethod
public void createCalendarEvent(String name, String location) {
   Log.d("CalendarModule", "Create event called with name: " + name
   + " and location: " + location);
}
```

kotlin

```
import android.util.Log

@ReactMethod
fun createCalendarEvent(name: String, location: String) {
    Log.d("CalendarModule", "Create event called with name: $name and location: $location")
}
```

Once you finish implementing the native module and hook it up in JavaScript, you can follow these steps to view the logs from your app.

#### Synchronous Methods

You can pass `isBlockingSynchronousMethod = true` to a native method to mark it as a synchronous method.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
@ReactMethod(isBlockingSynchronousMethod = true)
```

kotlin

```
@ReactMethod(isBlockingSynchronousMethod = true)
```

At the moment, we do not recommend this, since calling methods synchronously can have strong performance penalties and introduce threading-related bugs to your native modules. Additionally, please note that if you choose to enable `isBlockingSynchronousMethod`, your app can no longer use the Google Chrome debugger. This is because synchronous methods require the JS VM to share memory with the app. For the Google Chrome debugger, React Native runs inside the JS VM in Google Chrome, and communicates asynchronously with the mobile devices via WebSockets.

#### Register the Module (Android Specific)

Once a native module is written, it needs to be registered with React Native. In order to do so, you need to add your native module to a `ReactPackage` and register the `ReactPackage` with React Native. During initialization, React Native will loop over all packages, and for each `ReactPackage`, register each native module within.

React Native invokes the method `createNativeModules()` on a `ReactPackage` in order to get the list of native modules to register. For Android, if a module is not instantiated and returned in createNativeModules it will not be available from JavaScript.

To add your Native Module to `ReactPackage`, first create a new Java/Kotlin Class named (`MyAppPackage.java` or `MyAppPackage.kt`) that implements `ReactPackage` inside the `android/app/src/main/java/com/your-app-name/` folder:

Then add the following content:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
package com.your-app-name; // replace your-app-name with your app’s name
import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ViewManager;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class MyAppPackage implements ReactPackage {

   @Override
   public List<ViewManager> createViewManagers(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {
       return Collections.emptyList();
   }

   @Override
   public List<NativeModule> createNativeModules(
           ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {
       List<NativeModule> modules = new ArrayList<>();

       modules.add(new CalendarModule(reactContext));

       return modules;
   }

}
```

kotlin

```
package com.your-app-name // replace your-app-name with your app’s name

import android.view.View
import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage
import com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ReactShadowNode
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ViewManager

class MyAppPackage : ReactPackage {

    override fun createViewManagers(
        reactContext: ReactApplicationContext
    ): MutableList<ViewManager<View, ReactShadowNode<*>>> = mutableListOf()

    override fun createNativeModules(
        reactContext: ReactApplicationContext
    ): MutableList<NativeModule> = listOf(CalendarModule(reactContext)).toMutableList()
}
```

This file imports the native module you created, `CalendarModule`. It then instantiates `CalendarModule` within the `createNativeModules()` function and returns it as a list of `NativeModules` to register. If you add more native modules down the line, you can also instantiate them and add them to the list returned here.

> It is worth noting that this way of registering native modules eagerly initializes all native modules when the application starts, which adds to the startup time of an application. You can use TurboReactPackage as an alternative. Instead of `createNativeModules`, which return a list of instantiated native module objects, TurboReactPackage implements a `getModule(String name, ReactApplicationContext rac)` method that creates the native module object, when required. TurboReactPackage is a bit more complicated to implement at the moment. In addition to implementing a `getModule()` method, you have to implement a `getReactModuleInfoProvider()` method, which returns a list of all the native modules the package can instantiate along with a function that instantiates them, example here. Again, using TurboReactPackage will allow your application to have a faster startup time, but it is currently a bit cumbersome to write. So proceed with caution if you choose to use TurboReactPackages.

To register the `CalendarModule` package, you must add `MyAppPackage` to the list of packages returned in ReactNativeHost's `getPackages()` method. Open up your `MainApplication.java` or `MainApplication.kt` file, which can be found in the following path: `android/app/src/main/java/com/your-app-name/`.

Locate ReactNativeHost’s `getPackages()` method and add your package to the packages list `getPackages()` returns:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
@Override
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    List<ReactPackage> packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
    // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
    // packages.add(new MyReactNativePackage());
    packages.add(new MyAppPackage());
    return packages;
}
```

kotlin

```
override fun getPackages(): List<ReactPackage> =
    PackageList(this).packages.apply {
        // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
        // add(MyReactNativePackage())
        add(MyAppPackage())
    }
```

You have now successfully registered your native module for Android!

#### Test What You Have Built

At this point, you have set up the basic scaffolding for your native module in Android. Test that out by accessing the native module and invoking its exported method in JavaScript.

Find a place in your application where you would like to add a call to the native module’s `createCalendarEvent()` method. Below is an example of a component, `NewModuleButton` you can add in your app. You can invoke the native module inside `NewModuleButton`'s `onPress()` function.

```
import React from 'react';
import {NativeModules, Button} from 'react-native';

const NewModuleButton = () => {
  const onPress = () => {
    console.log('We will invoke the native module here!');
  };

  return (
    <Button
      title="Click to invoke your native module!"
      color="#841584"
      onPress={onPress}
    />
  );
};

export default NewModuleButton;
```

In order to access your native module from JavaScript you need to first import `NativeModules` from React Native:

```
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
```

You can then access the `CalendarModule` native module off of `NativeModules`.

```
const {CalendarModule} = NativeModules;
```

Now that you have the CalendarModule native module available, you can invoke your native method `createCalendarEvent()`. Below it is added to the `onPress()` method in `NewModuleButton`:

```
const onPress = () => {
  CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent('testName', 'testLocation');
};
```

The final step is to rebuild the React Native app so that you can have the latest native code (with your new native module!) available. In your command line, where the react native application is located, run the following:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run android
```

shell

```
yarn android
```

#### Building as You Iterate

As you work through these guides and iterate on your native module, you will need to do a native rebuild of your application to access your most recent changes from JavaScript. This is because the code that you are writing sits within the native part of your application. While React Native’s metro bundler can watch for changes in JavaScript and rebuild on the fly for you, it will not do so for native code. So if you want to test your latest native changes you need to rebuild by using the above command.

#### Recap✨

You should now be able to invoke your `createCalendarEvent()` method on your native module in the app. In our example this occurs by pressing the `NewModuleButton`. You can confirm this by viewing the log you set up in your `createCalendarEvent()` method. You can follow these steps to view ADB logs in your app. You should then be able to search for your `Log.d` message (in our example “Create event called with name: testName and location: testLocation”) and see your message logged each time you invoke your native module method.

Image of ADB logs in Android Studio

At this point you have created an Android native module and invoked its native method from JavaScript in your React Native application. You can read on to learn more about things like argument types available to a native module method and how to setup callbacks and promises.

### Beyond a Calendar Native Module

#### Better Native Module Export

Importing your native module by pulling it off of `NativeModules` like above is a bit clunky.

To save consumers of your native module from needing to do that each time they want to access your native module, you can create a JavaScript wrapper for the module. Create a new JavaScript file named `CalendarModule.js` with the following content:

```
/**
* This exposes the native CalendarModule module as a JS module. This has a
* function 'createCalendarEvent' which takes the following parameters:

* 1. String name: A string representing the name of the event
* 2. String location: A string representing the location of the event
*/
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
const {CalendarModule} = NativeModules;
export default CalendarModule;
```

This JavaScript file also becomes a good location for you to add any JavaScript side functionality. For example, if you use a type system like TypeScript you can add type annotations for your native module here. While React Native does not yet support Native to JS type safety, all your JS code will be type safe. Doing so will also make it easier for you to switch to type-safe native modules down the line. Below is an example of adding type safety to the CalendarModule:

```
/**
 * This exposes the native CalendarModule module as a JS module. This has a
 * function 'createCalendarEvent' which takes the following parameters:
 *
 * 1. String name: A string representing the name of the event
 * 2. String location: A string representing the location of the event
 */
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
const {CalendarModule} = NativeModules;
interface CalendarInterface {
  createCalendarEvent(name: string, location: string): void;
}
export default CalendarModule as CalendarInterface;
```

In your other JavaScript files you can access the native module and invoke its method like this:

```
import CalendarModule from './CalendarModule';
CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent('foo', 'bar');
```

> This assumes that the place you are importing `CalendarModule` is in the same hierarchy as `CalendarModule.js`. Please update the relative import as necessary.

#### Argument Types

When a native module method is invoked in JavaScript, React Native converts the arguments from JS objects to their Java/Kotlin object analogues. So for example, if your Java Native Module method accepts a double, in JS you need to call the method with a number. React Native will handle the conversion for you. Below is a list of the argument types supported for native module methods and the JavaScript equivalents they map to.

| Java          | Kotlin        | JavaScript |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Boolean       | Boolean       | ?boolean   |
| boolean       |               | boolean    |
| Double        | Double        | ?number    |
| double        |               | number     |
| String        | String        | string     |
| Callback      | Callback      | Function   |
| Promise       | Promise       | Promise    |
| ReadableMap   | ReadableMap   | Object     |
| ReadableArray | ReadableArray | Array      |

> The following types are currently supported but will not be supported in TurboModules. Please avoid using them:
>
> - Integer Java/Kotlin -> ?number
> - Float Java/Kotlin -> ?number
> - int Java -> number
> - float Java -> number

For argument types not listed above, you will need to handle the conversion yourself. For example, in Android, `Date` conversion is not supported out of the box. You can handle the conversion to the `Date` type within the native method yourself like so:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
    String dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd";
    SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(dateFormat);
    Calendar eStartDate = Calendar.getInstance();
    try {
        eStartDate.setTime(sdf.parse(startDate));
    }
```

kotlin

```
    val dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd"
    val sdf = SimpleDateFormat(dateFormat, Locale.US)
    val eStartDate = Calendar.getInstance()
    try {
        sdf.parse(startDate)?.let {
            eStartDate.time = it
        }
    }
```

#### Exporting Constants

A native module can export constants by implementing the native method `getConstants()`, which is available in JS. Below you will implement `getConstants()` and return a Map that contains a `DEFAULT_EVENT_NAME` constant you can access in JavaScript:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
@Override
public Map<String, Object> getConstants() {
   final Map<String, Object> constants = new HashMap<>();
   constants.put("DEFAULT_EVENT_NAME", "New Event");
   return constants;
}
```

kotlin

```
override fun getConstants(): MutableMap<String, Any> =
    hashMapOf("DEFAULT_EVENT_NAME" to "New Event")
```

The constant can then be accessed by invoking `getConstants` on the native module in JS:

```
const {DEFAULT_EVENT_NAME} = CalendarModule.getConstants();
console.log(DEFAULT_EVENT_NAME);
```

Technically it is possible to access constants exported in `getConstants()` directly off the native module object. This will no longer be supported with TurboModules, so we encourage the community to switch to the above approach to avoid necessary migration down the line.

> That currently constants are exported only at initialization time, so if you change getConstants values at runtime it won't affect the JavaScript environment. This will change with Turbomodules. With Turbomodules, `getConstants()` will become a regular native module method, and each invocation will hit the native side.

#### Callbacks

Native modules also support a unique kind of argument: a callback. Callbacks are used to pass data from Java/Kotlin to JavaScript for asynchronous methods. They can also be used to asynchronously execute JavaScript from the native side.

In order to create a native module method with a callback, first import the `Callback` interface, and then add a new parameter to your native module method of type `Callback`. There are a couple of nuances with callback arguments that will soon be lifted with TurboModules. First off, you can only have two callbacks in your function arguments- a successCallback and a failureCallback. In addition, the last argument to a native module method call, if it's a function, is treated as the successCallback, and the second to last argument to a native module method call, if it's a function, is treated as the failure callback.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
import com.facebook.react.bridge.Callback;

@ReactMethod
public void createCalendarEvent(String name, String location, Callback callBack) {
}
```

kotlin

```
import com.facebook.react.bridge.Callback

@ReactMethod fun createCalendarEvent(name: String, location: String, callback: Callback) {}
```

You can invoke the callback in your Java/Kotlin method, providing whatever data you want to pass to JavaScript. Please note that you can only pass serializable data from native code to JavaScript. If you need to pass back a native object you can use `WriteableMaps`, if you need to use a collection use `WritableArrays`. It is also important to highlight that the callback is not invoked immediately after the native function completes. Below the ID of an event created in an earlier call is passed to the callback.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
  @ReactMethod
   public void createCalendarEvent(String name, String location, Callback callBack) {
       Integer eventId = ...
       callBack.invoke(eventId);
   }
```

kotlin

```
  @ReactMethod
  fun createCalendarEvent(name: String, location: String, callback: Callback) {
      val eventId = ...
      callback.invoke(eventId)
  }
```

This method could then be accessed in JavaScript using:

```
const onPress = () => {
  CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent(
    'Party',
    'My House',
    eventId => {
      console.log(`Created a new event with id ${eventId}`);
    },
  );
};
```

Another important detail to note is that a native module method can only invoke one callback, one time. This means that you can either call a success callback or a failure callback, but not both, and each callback can only be invoked at most one time. A native module can, however, store the callback and invoke it later.

There are two approaches to error handling with callbacks. The first is to follow Node’s convention and treat the first argument passed to the callback as an error object.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
  @ReactMethod
   public void createCalendarEvent(String name, String location, Callback callBack) {
       Integer eventId = ...
       callBack.invoke(null, eventId);
   }
```

kotlin

```
  @ReactMethod
  fun createCalendarEvent(name: String, location: String, callback: Callback) {
      val eventId = ...
      callback.invoke(null, eventId)
  }
```

In JavaScript, you can then check the first argument to see if an error was passed through:

```
const onPress = () => {
  CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent(
    'testName',
    'testLocation',
    (error, eventId) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(`Error found! ${error}`);
      }
      console.log(`event id ${eventId} returned`);
    },
  );
};
```

Another option is to use an onSuccess and onFailure callback:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
@ReactMethod
public void createCalendarEvent(String name, String location, Callback myFailureCallback, Callback mySuccessCallback) {
}
```

kotlin

```
@ReactMethod
  fun createCalendarEvent(
      name: String,
      location: String,
      myFailureCallback: Callback,
      mySuccessCallback: Callback
  ) {}
```

Then in JavaScript you can add a separate callback for error and success responses:

```
const onPress = () => {
  CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent(
    'testName',
    'testLocation',
    error => {
      console.error(`Error found! ${error}`);
    },
    eventId => {
      console.log(`event id ${eventId} returned`);
    },
  );
};
```

#### Promises

Native modules can also fulfill a Promise, which can simplify your JavaScript, especially when using ES2016's async/await syntax. When the last parameter of a native module Java/Kotlin method is a Promise, its corresponding JS method will return a JS Promise object.

Refactoring the above code to use a promise instead of callbacks looks like this:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
import com.facebook.react.bridge.Promise;

@ReactMethod
public void createCalendarEvent(String name, String location, Promise promise) {
    try {
        Integer eventId = ...
        promise.resolve(eventId);
    } catch(Exception e) {
        promise.reject("Create Event Error", e);
    }
}
```

kotlin

```
import com.facebook.react.bridge.Promise

@ReactMethod
fun createCalendarEvent(name: String, location: String, promise: Promise) {
    try {
        val eventId = ...
        promise.resolve(eventId)
    } catch (e: Throwable) {
        promise.reject("Create Event Error", e)
    }
}
```

> Similar to callbacks, a native module method can either reject or resolve a promise (but not both) and can do so at most once. This means that you can either call a success callback or a failure callback, but not both, and each callback can only be invoked at most one time. A native module can, however, store the callback and invoke it later.

The JavaScript counterpart of this method returns a Promise. This means you can use the `await` keyword within an async function to call it and wait for its result:

```
const onSubmit = async () => {
  try {
    const eventId = await CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent(
      'Party',
      'My House',
    );
    console.log(`Created a new event with id ${eventId}`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
};
```

The reject method takes different combinations of the following arguments:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
String code, String message, WritableMap userInfo, Throwable throwable
```

kotlin

```
code: String, message: String, userInfo: WritableMap, throwable: Throwable
```

For more detail, you can find the `Promise.java` interface here. If `userInfo` is not provided, ReactNative will set it to null. For the rest of the parameters React Native will use a default value. The `message` argument provides the error `message` shown at the top of an error call stack. Below is an example of the error message shown in JavaScript from the following reject call in Java/Kotlin.

Java/Kotlin reject call:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
promise.reject("Create Event error", "Error parsing date", e);
```

kotlin

```
promise.reject("Create Event error", "Error parsing date", e)
```

Error message in React Native App when promise is rejected:

#### Sending Events to JavaScript

Native modules can signal events to JavaScript without being invoked directly. For example, you might want to signal to JavaScript a reminder that a calendar event from the native Android calendar app will occur soon. The easiest way to do this is to use the `RCTDeviceEventEmitter` which can be obtained from the `ReactContext` as in the code snippet below.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
...
import com.facebook.react.modules.core.DeviceEventManagerModule;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.WritableMap;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.Arguments;
...
private void sendEvent(ReactContext reactContext,
                      String eventName,
                      @Nullable WritableMap params) {
 reactContext
     .getJSModule(DeviceEventManagerModule.RCTDeviceEventEmitter.class)
     .emit(eventName, params);
}

private int listenerCount = 0;

@ReactMethod
public void addListener(String eventName) {
  if (listenerCount == 0) {
    // Set up any upstream listeners or background tasks as necessary
  }

  listenerCount += 1;
}

@ReactMethod
public void removeListeners(Integer count) {
  listenerCount -= count;
  if (listenerCount == 0) {
    // Remove upstream listeners, stop unnecessary background tasks
  }
}
...
WritableMap params = Arguments.createMap();
params.putString("eventProperty", "someValue");
...
sendEvent(reactContext, "EventReminder", params);
```

kotlin

```
...
import com.facebook.react.bridge.WritableMap
import com.facebook.react.bridge.Arguments
import com.facebook.react.modules.core.DeviceEventManagerModule
...

private fun sendEvent(reactContext: ReactContext, eventName: String, params: WritableMap?) {
    reactContext
      .getJSModule(DeviceEventManagerModule.RCTDeviceEventEmitter::class.java)
      .emit(eventName, params)
}

private var listenerCount = 0

@ReactMethod
fun addListener(eventName: String) {
  if (listenerCount == 0) {
    // Set up any upstream listeners or background tasks as necessary
  }

  listenerCount += 1
}

@ReactMethod
fun removeListeners(count: Int) {
  listenerCount -= count
  if (listenerCount == 0) {
    // Remove upstream listeners, stop unnecessary background tasks
  }
}
...
val params = Arguments.createMap().apply {
    putString("eventProperty", "someValue")
}
...
sendEvent(reactContext, "EventReminder", params)
```

JavaScript modules can then register to receive events by `addListener` on the NativeEventEmitter class.

```
import {NativeEventEmitter, NativeModules} from 'react-native';
...
useEffect(() => {
    const eventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(NativeModules.ToastExample);
    let eventListener = eventEmitter.addListener('EventReminder', event => {
      console.log(event.eventProperty) // "someValue"
    });

    // Removes the listener once unmounted
    return () => {
      eventListener.remove();
    };
  }, []);
```

#### Getting Activity Result from startActivityForResult

You'll need to listen to `onActivityResult` if you want to get results from an activity you started with `startActivityForResult`. To do this, you must extend `BaseActivityEventListener` or implement `ActivityEventListener`. The former is preferred as it is more resilient to API changes. Then, you need to register the listener in the module's constructor like so:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
reactContext.addActivityEventListener(mActivityResultListener);
```

kotlin

```
reactContext.addActivityEventListener(mActivityResultListener);
```

Now you can listen to `onActivityResult` by implementing the following method:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
@Override
public void onActivityResult(
 final Activity activity,
 final int requestCode,
 final int resultCode,
 final Intent intent) {
 // Your logic here
}
```

kotlin

```
override fun onActivityResult(
    activity: Activity?,
    requestCode: Int,
    resultCode: Int,
    intent: Intent?
) {
    // Your logic here
}
```

Let's implement a basic image picker to demonstrate this. The image picker will expose the method `pickImage` to JavaScript, which will return the path of the image when called.

- Java
- Kotlin

kotlin

```
public class ImagePickerModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {

  private static final int IMAGE_PICKER_REQUEST = 1;
  private static final String E_ACTIVITY_DOES_NOT_EXIST = "E_ACTIVITY_DOES_NOT_EXIST";
  private static final String E_PICKER_CANCELLED = "E_PICKER_CANCELLED";
  private static final String E_FAILED_TO_SHOW_PICKER = "E_FAILED_TO_SHOW_PICKER";
  private static final String E_NO_IMAGE_DATA_FOUND = "E_NO_IMAGE_DATA_FOUND";

  private Promise mPickerPromise;

  private final ActivityEventListener mActivityEventListener = new BaseActivityEventListener() {

    @Override
    public void onActivityResult(Activity activity, int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {
      if (requestCode == IMAGE_PICKER_REQUEST) {
        if (mPickerPromise != null) {
          if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_CANCELED) {
            mPickerPromise.reject(E_PICKER_CANCELLED, "Image picker was cancelled");
          } else if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
            Uri uri = intent.getData();

            if (uri == null) {
              mPickerPromise.reject(E_NO_IMAGE_DATA_FOUND, "No image data found");
            } else {
              mPickerPromise.resolve(uri.toString());
            }
          }

          mPickerPromise = null;
        }
      }
    }
  };

  ImagePickerModule(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {
    super(reactContext);

    // Add the listener for `onActivityResult`
    reactContext.addActivityEventListener(mActivityEventListener);
  }

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return "ImagePickerModule";
  }

  @ReactMethod
  public void pickImage(final Promise promise) {
    Activity currentActivity = getCurrentActivity();

    if (currentActivity == null) {
      promise.reject(E_ACTIVITY_DOES_NOT_EXIST, "Activity doesn't exist");
      return;
    }

    // Store the promise to resolve/reject when picker returns data
    mPickerPromise = promise;

    try {
      final Intent galleryIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK);

      galleryIntent.setType("image/*");

      final Intent chooserIntent = Intent.createChooser(galleryIntent, "Pick an image");

      currentActivity.startActivityForResult(chooserIntent, IMAGE_PICKER_REQUEST);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      mPickerPromise.reject(E_FAILED_TO_SHOW_PICKER, e);
      mPickerPromise = null;
    }
  }
}
```

kotlin

```
class ImagePickerModule(reactContext: ReactApplicationContext) :
    ReactContextBaseJavaModule(reactContext) {

    private var pickerPromise: Promise? = null

    private val activityEventListener =
        object : BaseActivityEventListener() {
            override fun onActivityResult(
                activity: Activity?,
                requestCode: Int,
                resultCode: Int,
                intent: Intent?
            ) {
                if (requestCode == IMAGE_PICKER_REQUEST) {
                    pickerPromise?.let { promise ->
                        when (resultCode) {
                            Activity.RESULT_CANCELED ->
                                promise.reject(E_PICKER_CANCELLED, "Image picker was cancelled")
                            Activity.RESULT_OK -> {
                                val uri = intent?.data

                                uri?.let { promise.resolve(uri.toString())}
                                    ?: promise.reject(E_NO_IMAGE_DATA_FOUND, "No image data found")
                            }
                        }

                        pickerPromise = null
                    }
                }
            }
        }

    init {
        reactContext.addActivityEventListener(activityEventListener)
    }

    override fun getName() = "ImagePickerModule"

    @ReactMethod
    fun pickImage(promise: Promise) {
        val activity = currentActivity

        if (activity == null) {
            promise.reject(E_ACTIVITY_DOES_NOT_EXIST, "Activity doesn't exist")
            return
        }

        pickerPromise = promise

        try {
            val galleryIntent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK).apply { type = "image\/*" }

            val chooserIntent = Intent.createChooser(galleryIntent, "Pick an image")

            activity.startActivityForResult(chooserIntent, IMAGE_PICKER_REQUEST)
        } catch (t: Throwable) {
            pickerPromise?.reject(E_FAILED_TO_SHOW_PICKER, t)
            pickerPromise = null
        }
    }

    companion object {
        const val IMAGE_PICKER_REQUEST = 1
        const val E_ACTIVITY_DOES_NOT_EXIST = "E_ACTIVITY_DOES_NOT_EXIST"
        const val E_PICKER_CANCELLED = "E_PICKER_CANCELLED"
        const val E_FAILED_TO_SHOW_PICKER = "E_FAILED_TO_SHOW_PICKER"
        const val E_NO_IMAGE_DATA_FOUND = "E_NO_IMAGE_DATA_FOUND"
    }
}
```

#### Listening to Lifecycle Events

Listening to the activity's LifeCycle events such as `onResume`, `onPause` etc. is very similar to how `ActivityEventListener` was implemented. The module must implement `LifecycleEventListener`. Then, you need to register a listener in the module's constructor like so:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
reactContext.addLifecycleEventListener(this);
```

kotlin

```
reactContext.addLifecycleEventListener(this)
```

Now you can listen to the activity's LifeCycle events by implementing the following methods:

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
@Override
public void onHostResume() {
   // Activity `onResume`
}
@Override
public void onHostPause() {
   // Activity `onPause`
}
@Override
public void onHostDestroy() {
   // Activity `onDestroy`
}
```

kotlin

```
override fun onHostResume() {
    // Activity `onResume`
}

override fun onHostPause() {
    // Activity `onPause`
}

override fun onHostDestroy() {
    // Activity `onDestroy`
}
```

#### Threading

To date, on Android, all native module async methods execute on one thread. Native modules should not have any assumptions about what thread they are being called on, as the current assignment is subject to change in the future. If a blocking call is required, the heavy work should be dispatched to an internally managed worker thread, and any callbacks distributed from there.

## iOS Native Modules

info

Native Module and Native Components are our stable technologies used by the legacy architecture. They will be deprecated in the future when the New Architecture will be stable. The New Architecture uses Turbo Native Module and Fabric Native Components to achieve similar results.

Welcome to Native Modules for iOS. Please start by reading the Native Modules Intro for an intro to what native modules are.

### Create a Calendar Native Module

In the following guide you will create a native module, `CalendarModule`, that will allow you to access Apple's calendar APIs from JavaScript. By the end you will be able to call `CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent('Dinner Party', 'My House');` from JavaScript, invoking a native method that creates a calendar event.

#### Setup

To get started, open up the iOS project within your React Native application in Xcode. You can find your iOS project here within a React Native app:

Image of where you can find your iOS project

We recommend using Xcode to write your native code. Xcode is built for iOS development, and using it will help you to quickly resolve smaller errors like code syntax.

#### Create Custom Native Module Files

The first step is to create our main custom native module header and implementation files. Create a new file called `RCTCalendarModule.h`

Image of creating a custom native module file within the same folder as AppDelegate

and add the following to it:

objectivec

```
//  RCTCalendarModule.h
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
@interface RCTCalendarModule : NSObject <RCTBridgeModule>
@end
```

You can use any name that fits the native module you are building. Name the class `RCTCalendarModule` since you are creating a calendar native module. Since ObjC does not have language-level support for namespaces like Java or C++, convention is to prepend the class name with a substring. This could be an abbreviation of your application name or your infra name. RCT, in this example, refers to React.

As you can see below, the CalendarModule class implements the `RCTBridgeModule` protocol. A native module is an Objective-C class that implements the `RCTBridgeModule` protocol.

Next up, let’s start implementing the native module. Create the corresponding implementation file using cocoa touch class in xcode, `RCTCalendarModule.m`, in the same folder and include the following content:

objectivec

```
// RCTCalendarModule.m
#import "RCTCalendarModule.h"

@implementation RCTCalendarModule

// To export a module named RCTCalendarModule
RCT_EXPORT_MODULE();

@end
```

#### Module Name

For now, your `RCTCalendarModule.m` native module only includes a `RCT_EXPORT_MODULE` macro, which exports and registers the native module class with React Native. The `RCT_EXPORT_MODULE` macro also takes an optional argument that specifies the name that the module will be accessible as in your JavaScript code.

This argument is not a string literal. In the example below `RCT_EXPORT_MODULE(CalendarModuleFoo)` is passed, not `RCT_EXPORT_MODULE("CalendarModuleFoo")`.

objectivec

```
// To export a module named CalendarModuleFoo
RCT_EXPORT_MODULE(CalendarModuleFoo);
```

The native module can then be accessed in JS like this:

```
const {CalendarModuleFoo} = ReactNative.NativeModules;
```

If you do not specify a name, the JavaScript module name will match the Objective-C class name, with any "RCT" or "RK" prefixes removed.

Let's follow the example below and call `RCT_EXPORT_MODULE` without any arguments. As a result, the module will be exposed to React Native using the name `CalendarModule`, since that is the Objective-C class name, with RCT removed.

objectivec

```
// Without passing in a name this will export the native module name as the Objective-C class name with “RCT” removed
RCT_EXPORT_MODULE();
```

The native module can then be accessed in JS like this:

```
const {CalendarModule} = ReactNative.NativeModules;
```

#### Export a Native Method to JavaScript

React Native will not expose any methods in a native module to JavaScript unless explicitly told to. This can be done using the `RCT_EXPORT_METHOD` macro. Methods written in the `RCT_EXPORT_METHOD` macro are asynchronous and the return type is therefore always void. In order to pass a result from a `RCT_EXPORT_METHOD` method to JavaScript you can use callbacks or emit events (covered below). Let’s go ahead and set up a native method for our `CalendarModule` native module using the `RCT_EXPORT_METHOD` macro. Call it `createCalendarEvent()` and for now have it take in name and location arguments as strings. Argument type options will be covered shortly.

objectivec

```
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(createCalendarEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location)
{
}
```

> Please note that the `RCT_EXPORT_METHOD` macro will not be necessary with TurboModules unless your method relies on RCT argument conversion (see argument types below). Ultimately, React Native will remove `RCT_EXPORT_MACRO,` so we discourage people from using `RCTConvert`. Instead, you can do the argument conversion within the method body.

Before you build out the `createCalendarEvent()` method’s functionality, add a console log in the method so you can confirm it has been invoked from JavaScript in your React Native application. Use the `RCTLog` APIs from React. Let’s import that header at the top of your file and then add the log call.

objectivec

```
#import <React/RCTLog.h>
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(createCalendarEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location)
{
 RCTLogInfo(@"Pretending to create an event %@ at %@", name, location);
}
```

#### Synchronous Methods

You can use the `RCT_EXPORT_BLOCKING_SYNCHRONOUS_METHOD` to create a synchronous native method.

objectivec

```
RCT_EXPORT_BLOCKING_SYNCHRONOUS_METHOD(getName)
{
return [[UIDevice currentDevice] name];
}
```

The return type of this method must be of object type (id) and should be serializable to JSON. This means that the hook can only return nil or JSON values (e.g. NSNumber, NSString, NSArray, NSDictionary).

At the moment, we do not recommend using synchronous methods, since calling methods synchronously can have strong performance penalties and introduce threading-related bugs to your native modules. Additionally, please note that if you choose to use `RCT_EXPORT_BLOCKING_SYNCHRONOUS_METHOD`, your app can no longer use the Google Chrome debugger. This is because synchronous methods require the JS VM to share memory with the app. For the Google Chrome debugger, React Native runs inside the JS VM in Google Chrome, and communicates asynchronously with the mobile devices via WebSockets.

#### Test What You Have Built

At this point you have set up the basic scaffolding for your native module in iOS. Test that out by accessing the native module and invoking it’s exported method in JavaScript.

Find a place in your application where you would like to add a call to the native module’s `createCalendarEvent()` method. Below is an example of a component, `NewModuleButton` you can add in your app. You can invoke the native module inside `NewModuleButton`'s `onPress()` function.

```
import React from 'react';
import {Button} from 'react-native';

const NewModuleButton = () => {
  const onPress = () => {
    console.log('We will invoke the native module here!');
  };

  return (
    <Button
      title="Click to invoke your native module!"
      color="#841584"
      onPress={onPress}
    />
  );
};

export default NewModuleButton;
```

In order to access your native module from JavaScript you need to first import `NativeModules` from React Native:

```
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
```

You can then access the `CalendarModule` native module off of `NativeModules`.

```
const {CalendarModule} = NativeModules;
```

Now that you have the CalendarModule native module available, you can invoke your native method `createCalendarEvent()`. Below it is added to the `onPress()` method in `NewModuleButton`:

```
const onPress = () => {
  CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent('testName', 'testLocation');
};
```

The final step is to rebuild the React Native app so that you can have the latest native code (with your new native module!) available. In your command line, where the react native application is located, run the following :

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run ios
```

shell

```
yarn ios
```

#### Building as You Iterate

As you work through these guides and iterate on your native module, you will need to do a native rebuild of your application to access your most recent changes from JavaScript. This is because the code that you are writing sits within the native part of your application. While React Native’s metro bundler can watch for changes in JavaScript and rebuild JS bundle on the fly for you, it will not do so for native code. So if you want to test your latest native changes you need to rebuild by using the above command.

#### Recap✨

You should now be able to invoke your `createCalendarEvent()` method on your native module in JavaScript. Since you are using `RCTLog` in the function, you can confirm your native method is being invoked by enabling debug mode in your app and looking at the JS console in Chrome or the mobile app debugger Flipper. You should see your `RCTLogInfo(@"Pretending to create an event %@ at %@", name, location);` message each time you invoke the native module method.

Image of iOS logs in Flipper

At this point you have created an iOS native module and invoked a method on it from JavaScript in your React Native application. You can read on to learn more about things like what argument types your native module method takes and how to setup callbacks and promises within your native module.

### Beyond a Calendar Native Module

#### Better Native Module Export

Importing your native module by pulling it off of `NativeModules` like above is a bit clunky.

To save consumers of your native module from needing to do that each time they want to access your native module, you can create a JavaScript wrapper for the module. Create a new JavaScript file named NativeCalendarModule.js with the following content:

```
/**
* This exposes the native CalendarModule module as a JS module. This has a
* function 'createCalendarEvent' which takes the following parameters:

* 1. String name: A string representing the name of the event
* 2. String location: A string representing the location of the event
*/
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
const {CalendarModule} = NativeModules;
export default CalendarModule;
```

This JavaScript file also becomes a good location for you to add any JavaScript side functionality. For example, if you use a type system like TypeScript you can add type annotations for your native module here. While React Native does not yet support Native to JS type safety, with these type annotations, all your JS code will be type safe. These annotations will also make it easier for you to switch to type-safe native modules down the line. Below is an example of adding type safety to the Calendar Module:

```
/**
 * This exposes the native CalendarModule module as a JS module. This has a
 * function 'createCalendarEvent' which takes the following parameters:
 *
 * 1. String name: A string representing the name of the event
 * 2. String location: A string representing the location of the event
 */
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
const {CalendarModule} = NativeModules;
interface CalendarInterface {
  createCalendarEvent(name: string, location: string): void;
}
export default CalendarModule as CalendarInterface;
```

In your other JavaScript files you can access the native module and invoke its method like this:

```
import NativeCalendarModule from './NativeCalendarModule';
NativeCalendarModule.createCalendarEvent('foo', 'bar');
```

> Note this assumes that the place you are importing `CalendarModule` is in the same hierarchy as `NativeCalendarModule.js`. Please update the relative import as necessary.

#### Argument Types

When a native module method is invoked in JavaScript, React Native converts the arguments from JS objects to their Objective-C/Swift object analogues. So for example, if your Objective-C Native Module method accepts a NSNumber, in JS you need to call the method with a number. React Native will handle the conversion for you. Below is a list of the argument types supported for native module methods and the JavaScript equivalents they map to.

| Objective-C                                   | JavaScript         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| NSString                                      | string, ?string    |
| BOOL                                          | boolean            |
| double                                        | number             |
| NSNumber                                      | ?number            |
| NSArray                                       | Array, ?Array      |
| NSDictionary                                  | Object, ?Object    |
| RCTResponseSenderBlock                        | Function (success) |
| RCTResponseSenderBlock, RCTResponseErrorBlock | Function (failure) |
| RCTPromiseResolveBlock, RCTPromiseRejectBlock | Promise            |

> The following types are currently supported but will not be supported in TurboModules. Please avoid using them.
>
> - Function (failure) -> RCTResponseErrorBlock
> - Number -> NSInteger
> - Number -> CGFloat
> - Number -> float

For iOS, you can also write native module methods with any argument type that is supported by the `RCTConvert` class (see RCTConvert for details about what is supported). The RCTConvert helper functions all accept a JSON value as input and map it to a native Objective-C type or class.

#### Exporting Constants

A native module can export constants by overriding the native method `constantsToExport()`. Below `constantsToExport()` is overridden, and returns a Dictionary that contains a default event name property you can access in JavaScript like so:

objectivec

```
- (NSDictionary *)constantsToExport
{
 return @{ @"DEFAULT_EVENT_NAME": @"New Event" };
}
```

The constant can then be accessed by invoking `getConstants()` on the native module in JS like so:

```
const {DEFAULT_EVENT_NAME} = CalendarModule.getConstants();
console.log(DEFAULT_EVENT_NAME);
```

Technically, it is possible to access constants exported in `constantsToExport()` directly off the `NativeModule` object. This will no longer be supported with TurboModules, so we encourage the community to switch to the above approach to avoid necessary migration down the line.

> Note that the constants are exported only at initialization time, so if you change `constantsToExport()` values at runtime it won't affect the JavaScript environment.

For iOS, if you override `constantsToExport()` then you should also implement `+ requiresMainQueueSetup` to let React Native know if your module needs to be initialized on the main thread, before any JavaScript code executes. Otherwise you will see a warning that in the future your module may be initialized on a background thread unless you explicitly opt out with `+ requiresMainQueueSetup:`. If your module does not require access to UIKit, then you should respond to `+ requiresMainQueueSetup` with NO.

#### Callbacks

Native modules also support a unique kind of argument - a callback. Callbacks are used to pass data from Objective-C to JavaScript for asynchronous methods. They can also be used to asynchronously execute JS from the native side.

For iOS, callbacks are implemented using the type `RCTResponseSenderBlock`. Below the callback parameter `myCallBack` is added to the `createCalendarEventMethod()`:

objectivec

```
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(createCalendarEvent:(NSString *)title
                location:(NSString *)location
                myCallback:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback)
```

You can then invoke the callback in your native function, providing whatever result you want to pass to JavaScript in an array. Note that `RCTResponseSenderBlock` accepts only one argument - an array of parameters to pass to the JavaScript callback. Below you will pass back the ID of an event created in an earlier call.

> It is important to highlight that the callback is not invoked immediately after the native function completes—remember the communication is asynchronous.

objectivec

```
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(createCalendarEvent:(NSString *)title location:(NSString *)location callback: (RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback)
{
 NSInteger eventId = ...
 callback(@[@(eventId)]);

 RCTLogInfo(@"Pretending to create an event %@ at %@", title, location);
}
```

This method could then be accessed in JavaScript using the following:

```
const onSubmit = () => {
  CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent(
    'Party',
    '04-12-2020',
    eventId => {
      console.log(`Created a new event with id ${eventId}`);
    },
  );
};
```

A native module is supposed to invoke its callback only once. It can, however, store the callback and invoke it later. This pattern is often used to wrap iOS APIs that require delegates— see `RCTAlertManager` for an example. If the callback is never invoked, some memory is leaked.

There are two approaches to error handling with callbacks. The first is to follow Node’s convention and treat the first argument passed to the callback array as an error object.

objectivec

```
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(createCalendarEventCallback:(NSString *)title location:(NSString *)location callback: (RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback)
{
  NSNumber *eventId = [NSNumber numberWithInt:123];
  callback(@[[NSNull null], eventId]);
}
```

In JavaScript, you can then check the first argument to see if an error was passed through:

```
const onPress = () => {
  CalendarModule.createCalendarEventCallback(
    'testName',
    'testLocation',
    (error, eventId) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(`Error found! ${error}`);
      }
      console.log(`event id ${eventId} returned`);
    },
  );
};
```

Another option is to use two separate callbacks: onFailure and onSuccess.

objectivec

```
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(createCalendarEventCallback:(NSString *)title
                  location:(NSString *)location
                  errorCallback: (RCTResponseSenderBlock)errorCallback
                  successCallback: (RCTResponseSenderBlock)successCallback)
{
  @try {
    NSNumber *eventId = [NSNumber numberWithInt:123];
    successCallback(@[eventId]);
  }

  @catch ( NSException *e ) {
    errorCallback(@[e]);
  }
}
```

Then in JavaScript you can add a separate callback for error and success responses:

```
const onPress = () => {
  CalendarModule.createCalendarEventCallback(
    'testName',
    'testLocation',
    error => {
      console.error(`Error found! ${error}`);
    },
    eventId => {
      console.log(`event id ${eventId} returned`);
    },
  );
};
```

If you want to pass error-like objects to JavaScript, use `RCTMakeError` from `RCTUtils.h.` Right now this only passes an Error-shaped dictionary to JavaScript, but React Native aims to automatically generate real JavaScript Error objects in the future. You can also provide a `RCTResponseErrorBlock` argument, which is used for error callbacks and accepts an `NSError \* object`. Please note that this argument type will not be supported with TurboModules.

#### Promises

Native modules can also fulfill a promise, which can simplify your JavaScript, especially when using ES2016's `async/await` syntax. When the last parameter of a native module method is a `RCTPromiseResolveBlock` and `RCTPromiseRejectBlock`, its corresponding JS method will return a JS Promise object.

Refactoring the above code to use a promise instead of callbacks looks like this:

objectivec

```
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(createCalendarEvent:(NSString *)title
                 location:(NSString *)location
                 resolver:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                 rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)
{
 NSInteger eventId = createCalendarEvent();
 if (eventId) {
    resolve(@(eventId));
  } else {
    reject(@"event_failure", @"no event id returned", nil);
  }
}
```

The JavaScript counterpart of this method returns a Promise. This means you can use the `await` keyword within an async function to call it and wait for its result:

```
const onSubmit = async () => {
  try {
    const eventId = await CalendarModule.createCalendarEvent(
      'Party',
      'my house',
    );
    console.log(`Created a new event with id ${eventId}`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
};
```

#### Sending Events to JavaScript

Native modules can signal events to JavaScript without being invoked directly. For example, you might want to signal to JavaScript a reminder that a calendar event from the native iOS calendar app will occur soon. The preferred way to do this is to subclass `RCTEventEmitter`, implement `supportedEvents` and call self `sendEventWithName`:

Update your header class to import `RCTEventEmitter` and subclass `RCTEventEmitter`:

objectivec

```
//  CalendarModule.h

#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
#import <React/RCTEventEmitter.h>

@interface CalendarModule : RCTEventEmitter <RCTBridgeModule>
@end
```

JavaScript code can subscribe to these events by creating a new `NativeEventEmitter` instance around your module.

You will receive a warning if you expend resources unnecessarily by emitting an event while there are no listeners. To avoid this, and to optimize your module's workload (e.g. by unsubscribing from upstream notifications or pausing background tasks), you can override `startObserving` and `stopObserving` in your `RCTEventEmitter` subclass.

objectivec

```
@implementation CalendarModule
{
  bool hasListeners;
}

// Will be called when this module's first listener is added.
-(void)startObserving {
    hasListeners = YES;
    // Set up any upstream listeners or background tasks as necessary
}

// Will be called when this module's last listener is removed, or on dealloc.
-(void)stopObserving {
    hasListeners = NO;
    // Remove upstream listeners, stop unnecessary background tasks
}

- (void)calendarEventReminderReceived:(NSNotification *)notification
{
  NSString *eventName = notification.userInfo[@"name"];
  if (hasListeners) {// Only send events if anyone is listening
    [self sendEventWithName:@"EventReminder" body:@{@"name": eventName}];
  }
}
```

#### Threading

Unless the native module provides its own method queue, it shouldn't make any assumptions about what thread it's being called on. Currently, if a native module doesn't provide a method queue, React Native will create a separate GCD queue for it and invoke its methods there. Please note that this is an implementation detail and might change. If you want to explicitly provide a method queue for a native module, override the `(dispatch_queue_t) methodQueue` method in the native module. For example, if it needs to use a main-thread-only iOS API, it should specify this via:

objectivec

```
- (dispatch_queue_t)methodQueue
{
  return dispatch_get_main_queue();
}
```

Similarly, if an operation may take a long time to complete, the native module can specify its own queue to run operations on. Again, currently React Native will provide a separate method queue for your native module, but this is an implementation detail you should not rely on. If you don't provide your own method queue, in the future, your native module's long running operations may end up blocking async calls being executed on other unrelated native modules. The `RCTAsyncLocalStorage` module here, for example, creates its own queue so the React queue isn't blocked waiting on potentially slow disk access.

objectivec

```
- (dispatch_queue_t)methodQueue
{
 return dispatch_queue_create("com.facebook.React.AsyncLocalStorageQueue", DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL);
}
```

The specified `methodQueue` will be shared by all of the methods in your module. If only one of your methods is long-running (or needs to be run on a different queue than the others for some reason), you can use `dispatch_async` inside the method to perform that particular method's code on another queue, without affecting the others:

objectivec

```
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(doSomethingExpensive:(NSString *)param callback:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback)
{
 dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
   // Call long-running code on background thread
   ...
   // You can invoke callback from any thread/queue
   callback(@[...]);
 });
}
```

> Sharing dispatch queues between modules
>
> The `methodQueue` method will be called once when the module is initialized, and then retained by React Native, so there is no need to keep a reference to the queue yourself, unless you wish to make use of it within your module. However, if you wish to share the same queue between multiple modules then you will need to ensure that you retain and return the same queue instance for each of them.

#### Dependency Injection

React Native will create and initialize any registered native modules automatically. However, you may wish to create and initialize your own module instances to, for example, inject dependencies.

You can do this by creating a class that implements the `RCTBridgeDelegate` Protocol, initializing an `RCTBridge` with the delegate as an argument and initialising a `RCTRootView` with the initialized bridge.

objectivec

```
id<RCTBridgeDelegate> moduleInitialiser = [[classThatImplementsRCTBridgeDelegate alloc] init];

RCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:moduleInitialiser launchOptions:nil];

RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc]
                        initWithBridge:bridge
                            moduleName:kModuleName
                     initialProperties:nil];
```

#### Exporting Swift

Swift doesn't have support for macros, so exposing native modules and their methods to JavaScript inside React Native requires a bit more setup. However, it works relatively the same. Let's say you have the same `CalendarModule` but as a Swift class:

swift

```
// CalendarModule.swift

@objc(CalendarModule)
class CalendarModule: NSObject {

 @objc(addEvent:location:date:)
 func addEvent(_ name: String, location: String, date: NSNumber) -> Void {
   // Date is ready to use!
 }

 @objc
 func constantsToExport() -> [String: Any]! {
   return ["someKey": "someValue"]
 }

}
```

> It is important to use the `@objc` modifiers to ensure the class and functions are exported properly to the Objective-C runtime.

Then create a private implementation file that will register the required information with React Native:

objectivec

```
// CalendarModuleBridge.m
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>

@interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(CalendarModule, NSObject)

RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location date:(nonnull NSNumber *)date)

@end
```

For those of you new to Swift and Objective-C, whenever you mix the two languages in an iOS project, you will also need an additional bridging file, known as a bridging header, to expose the Objective-C files to Swift. Xcode will offer to create this header file for you if you add your Swift file to your app through the Xcode `File>New File` menu option. You will need to import `RCTBridgeModule.h` in this header file.

objectivec

```
// CalendarModule-Bridging-Header.h
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
```

You can also use `RCT_EXTERN_REMAP_MODULE` and `_RCT_EXTERN_REMAP_METHOD` to alter the JavaScript name of the module or methods you are exporting. For more information see `RCTBridgeModule`.

> Important when making third party modules: Static libraries with Swift are only supported in Xcode 9 and later. In order for the Xcode project to build when you use Swift in the iOS static library you include in the module, your main app project must contain Swift code and a bridging header itself. If your app project does not contain any Swift code, a workaround can be a single empty .swift file and an empty bridging header.

#### Reserved Method Names

##### invalidate()

Native modules can conform to the RCTInvalidating protocol on iOS by implementing the `invalidate()` method. This method can be invoked when the native bridge is invalidated (ie: on devmode reload). Please use this mechanism as necessary to do the required cleanup for your native module.

## Key Concepts

The keys to integrating React Native components into your Android application are to:

1. Set up the correct directory structure.
2. Install the necessary NPM dependencies.
3. Adding React Native to your Gradle configuration.
4. Writing the TypeScript code for your first React Native screen.
5. Integrate React Native with your Android code using a ReactActivity.
6. Testing your integration by running the bundler and seeing your app in action.

### Using the Community Template

While you follow this guide, we suggest you to use the React Native Community Template as reference. The template contains a **minimal Android app** and will help you understanding how to integrate React Native into an existing Android app.

### Prerequisites

Follow the guide on setting up your development environment and using React Native without a framework to configure your development environment for building React Native apps for Android. This guide also assumes you're familiar with the basics of Android development such as creating Activities and editing the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

### 1. Set up directory structure

To ensure a smooth experience, create a new folder for your integrated React Native project, then **move your existing Android project** to the `/android` subfolder.

### 2. Install NPM dependencies

Go to the root directory and run the following command:

shell

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-community/template/refs/heads/0.75-stable/template/package.json
```

This will copy the `package.json` file from the Community template to your project.

Next, install the NPM packages by running:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm install
```

shell

```
yarn install
```

Installation process has created a new `node_modules` folder. This folder stores all the JavaScript dependencies required to build your project.

Add `node_modules/` to your `.gitignore` file (here the Community default one).

### 3. Adding React Native to your app

#### Configuring Gradle

React Native uses the React Native Gradle Plugin to configure your dependencies and project setup.

First, let's edit your `settings.gradle` file by adding those lines (as suggested from the Community template):

groovy

```
// Configures the React Native Gradle Settings plugin used for autolinking
pluginManagement { includeBuild("../node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin") }
plugins { id("com.facebook.react.settings") }
extensions.configure(com.facebook.react.ReactSettingsExtension){ ex -> ex.autolinkLibrariesFromCommand() }
// If using .gradle.kts files:
// extensions.configure<com.facebook.react.ReactSettingsExtension> { autolinkLibrariesFromCommand() }
includeBuild("../node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin")

// Include your existing Gradle modules here.
// include(":app")
```

Then you need to open your top level `build.gradle` and include this line (as suggested from the Community template):

diff

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.1")
+       classpath("com.facebook.react:react-native-gradle-plugin")
    }
}
```

This makes sure the React Native Gradle Plugin (RNGP) is available inside your project. Finally, add those lines inside your Applications's `build.gradle` file (it's a different `build.gradle` file usually inside your `app` folder - you can use the Community template file as reference):

diff

```
apply plugin: "com.android.application"
+apply plugin: "com.facebook.react"

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    // Other dependencies here
+   // Note: we intentionally don't specify the version number here as RNGP will take care of it.
+   // If you don't use the RNGP, you'll have to specify version manually.
+   implementation("com.facebook.react:react-android")
+   implementation("com.facebook.react:hermes-android")
}

+react {
+   // Needed to enable Autolinking - https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md
+   autolinkLibrariesWithApp()
+}
```

Finally, open your application `gradle.properties` files and add the following line (here the Community template file as reference):

diff

```
+reactNativeArchitectures=armeabi-v7a,arm64-v8a,x86,x86_64
+newArchEnabled=true
+hermesEnabled=true
```

#### Configuring your manifest

First, make sure you have the Internet permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

diff

```
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

+   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

    <application
      android:name=".MainApplication">
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Then you need to enable cleartext traffic in your **debug** `AndroidManifest.xml`:

diff

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">

    <application
+       android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
+       tools:targetApi="28"
    />
</manifest>
```

As usual, here the AndroidManifest.xml file from the Community template to use as a reference: main and debug

This is needed as your application will communicate with your local bundler, \[Metro]\[<https://metrobundler.dev/>], via HTTP.

Make sure you add this only to your **debug** manifest.

### 4. Writing the TypeScript Code

Now we will actually modify the native Android application to integrate React Native.

The first bit of code we will write is the actual React Native code for the new screen that will be integrated into our application.

#### Create a `index.js` file

First, create an empty `index.js` file in the root of your React Native project.

`index.js` is the starting point for React Native applications, and it is always required. It can be a small file that `import`s other file that are part of your React Native component or application, or it can contain all the code that is needed for it.

Our index.js should look as follows (here the Community template file as reference):

js

```
import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
import App from './App';

AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorld', () => App);
```

#### Create a `App.tsx` file

Let's create an `App.tsx` file. This is a TypeScript file that can have JSX expressions. It contains the root React Native component that we will integrate into our Android application (link):

```
import React from 'react';
import {
  SafeAreaView,
  ScrollView,
  StatusBar,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  useColorScheme,
  View,
} from 'react-native';

import {
  Colors,
  DebugInstructions,
  Header,
  ReloadInstructions,
} from 'react-native/Libraries/NewAppScreen';

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  const isDarkMode = useColorScheme() === 'dark';

  const backgroundStyle = {
    backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? Colors.darker : Colors.lighter,
  };

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={backgroundStyle}>
      <StatusBar
        barStyle={isDarkMode ? 'light-content' : 'dark-content'}
        backgroundColor={backgroundStyle.backgroundColor}
      />
      <ScrollView
        contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"
        style={backgroundStyle}>
        <Header />
        <View
          style={{
            backgroundColor: isDarkMode
              ? Colors.black
              : Colors.white,
            padding: 24,
          }}>
          <Text style={styles.title}>Step One</Text>
          <Text>
            Edit <Text style={styles.bold}>App.tsx</Text> to
            change this screen and see your edits.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.title}>See your changes</Text>
          <ReloadInstructions />
          <Text style={styles.title}>Debug</Text>
          <DebugInstructions />
        </View>
      </ScrollView>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: '600',
  },
  bold: {
    fontWeight: '700',
  },
});

export default App;
```

Here the Community template file as reference

### 5. Integrating with your Android code

We now need to add some native code in order to start the React Native runtime and tell it to render our React components.

#### Updating your Application class

First, we need to update your `Application` class to properly initialize React Native as follows:

- Java
- Kotlin

diff

```
package <your-package-here>;

import android.app.Application;
+import com.facebook.react.PackageList;
+import com.facebook.react.ReactApplication;
+import com.facebook.react.ReactHost;
+import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost;
+import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage;
+import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint;
+import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactHost;
+import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactNativeHost;
+import com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader;
+import com.facebook.react.soloader.OpenSourceMergedSoMapping
+import java.util.List;

-class MainApplication extends Application {
+class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
+ @Override
+ public ReactNativeHost getReactNativeHost() {
+   return new DefaultReactNativeHost(this) {
+     @Override
+     protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() { return new PackageList(this).getPackages(); }
+     @Override
+     protected String getJSMainModuleName() { return "index"; }
+     @Override
+     public boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() { return BuildConfig.DEBUG; }
+     @Override
+     protected boolean isNewArchEnabled() { return BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED; }
+     @Override
+     protected Boolean isHermesEnabled() { return BuildConfig.IS_HERMES_ENABLED; }
+   };
+ }

+ @Override
+ public ReactHost getReactHost() {
+   return DefaultReactHost.getDefaultReactHost(getApplicationContext(), getReactNativeHost());
+ }

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
+   SoLoader.init(this, OpenSourceMergedSoMapping);
+   if (BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED) {
+     DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.load();
+   }
  }
}
```

diff

```
// package <your-package-here>

import android.app.Application
+import com.facebook.react.PackageList
+import com.facebook.react.ReactApplication
+import com.facebook.react.ReactHost
+import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost
+import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage
+import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.load
+import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactHost.getDefaultReactHost
+import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactNativeHost
+import com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader
+import com.facebook.react.soloader.OpenSourceMergedSoMapping

-class MainApplication : Application() {
+class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {

+ override val reactNativeHost: ReactNativeHost =
+      object : DefaultReactNativeHost(this) {
+        override fun getPackages(): List<ReactPackage> = PackageList(this).packages
+        override fun getJSMainModuleName(): String = "index"
+        override fun getUseDeveloperSupport(): Boolean = BuildConfig.DEBUG
+        override val isNewArchEnabled: Boolean = BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED
+        override val isHermesEnabled: Boolean = BuildConfig.IS_HERMES_ENABLED
+      }

+ override val reactHost: ReactHost
+   get() = getDefaultReactHost(applicationContext, reactNativeHost)

  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
+   SoLoader.init(this, OpenSourceMergedSoMapping)
+   if (BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED) {
+     load()
+   }
  }
}
```

As usual, here the MainApplication.kt Community template file as reference

##### Creating a `ReactActivity`

Finally, we need to create a new `Activity` that will extend `ReactActivity` and host the React Native code. This activity will be responsible for starting the React Native runtime and rendering the React component.

- Java
- Kotlin

java

```
// package <your-package-here>;

import com.facebook.react.ReactActivity;
import com.facebook.react.ReactActivityDelegate;
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint;
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactActivityDelegate;

public class MyReactActivity extends ReactActivity {

    @Override
    protected String getMainComponentName() {
        return "HelloWorld";
    }

    @Override
    protected ReactActivityDelegate createReactActivityDelegate() {
        return new DefaultReactActivityDelegate(this, getMainComponentName(), DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.getFabricEnabled());
    }
}
```

kotlin

```
// package <your-package-here>

import com.facebook.react.ReactActivity
import com.facebook.react.ReactActivityDelegate
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.fabricEnabled
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactActivityDelegate

class MyReactActivity : ReactActivity() {

    override fun getMainComponentName(): String = "HelloWorld"

    override fun createReactActivityDelegate(): ReactActivityDelegate =
        DefaultReactActivityDelegate(this, mainComponentName, fabricEnabled)
}
```

As usual, here the MainActivity.kt Community template file as reference

Whenever you create a new Activity, you need to add it to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. You also need set the theme of `MyReactActivity` to `Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar` (or to any non-ActionBar theme) as otherwise your application will render an ActionBar on top of your React Native screen:

diff

```
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

    <application
      android:name=".MainApplication">

+     <activity
+       android:name=".MyReactActivity"
+       android:label="@string/app_name"
+       android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
+     </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Now your activity is ready to run some JavaScript code.

### 6. Test your integration

You have completed all the basic steps to integrate React Native with your application. Now we will start the Metro bundler to build your TypeScript application code into a bundle. Metro's HTTP server shares the bundle from `localhost` on your developer environment to a simulator or device. This allows for hot reloading.

First, you need to create a `metro.config.js` file in the root of your project as follows:

js

```
const {getDefaultConfig} = require('@react-native/metro-config');
module.exports = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
```

You can checkout the metro.config.js file from the Community template file as reference.

Once you have the config file in place, you can run the bundler. Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm start
```

shell

```
yarn start
```

Now build and run your Android app as normal.

Once you reach your React-powered Activity inside the app, it should load the JavaScript code from the development server and display:

#### Creating a release build in Android Studio

You can use Android Studio to create your release builds too! It’s as quick as creating release builds of your previously-existing native Android app.

The React Native Gradle Plugin will take care of bundling the JS code inside your APK/App Bundle.

If you're not using Android Studio, you can create a release build with:

```
cd android
# For a Release APK
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
# For a Release AAB
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease
```

#### Now what?

At this point you can continue developing your app as usual. Refer to our debugging and deployment docs to learn more about working with React Native.

### Key Concepts

The keys to integrating React Native components into your iOS application are to:

1. Set up the correct directory structure.
2. Install the necessary NPM dependencies.
3. Adding React Native to your Podfile configuration.
4. Writing the TypeScript code for your first React Native screen.
5. Integrate React Native with your iOS code using a `RCTRootView`.
6. Testing your integration by running the bundler and seeing your app in action.

### Using the Community Template

While you follow this guide, we suggest you to use the React Native Community Template as reference. The template contains a **minimal iOS app** and will help you understanding how to integrate React Native into an existing iOS app.

### Prerequisites

Follow the guide on setting up your development environment and using React Native without a framework to configure your development environment for building React Native apps for iOS. This guide also assumes you're familiar with the basics of iOS development such as creating a `UIViewController` and editing the `Podfile` file.

#### 1. Set up directory structure

To ensure a smooth experience, create a new folder for your integrated React Native project, then **move your existing iOS project** to the `/ios` subfolder.

### 2. Install NPM dependencies

Go to the root directory and run the following command:

shell

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-community/template/refs/heads/0.78-stable/template/package.json
```

This will copy the `package.json` file from the Community template to your project.

Next, install the NPM packages by running:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm install
```

shell

```
yarn install
```

Installation process has created a new `node_modules` folder. This folder stores all the JavaScript dependencies required to build your project.

Add `node_modules/` to your `.gitignore` file (here the Community default one).

#### 3. Install Development tools

#### Command Line Tools for Xcode

Install the Command Line Tools. Choose **Settings... (or Preferences...)** in the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.

#### CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a package management tool for iOS and macOS development. We use it to add the actual React Native framework code locally into your current project.

We recommend installing CocoaPods using Homebrew:

shell

```
brew install cocoapods
```

### 4. Adding React Native to your app

#### Configuring CocoaPods

To configure CocoaPods, we need two files:

- A **Gemfile** that defines which Ruby dependencies we need.
- A **Podfile** that defines how to properly install our dependencies.

For the **Gemfile**, go to the root directory of your project and run this command

sh

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-community/template/refs/heads/0.78-stable/template/Gemfile
```

This will download the Gemfile from the template.

note

If you created your project with Xcode 16, you need to update the Gemfile as it follows:

Xcode 16 generates a project in a slightly different ways from previous versions of Xcode, and you need the latest CocoaPods and Xcodeproj gems to make it work properly.

Similarly, for the **Podfile**, go to the `ios` folder of your project and run

sh

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-community/template/refs/heads/0.78-stable/template/ios/Podfile
```

Please use the Community Template as a reference point for the Gemfile and for the Podfile.

note

Now, we need to run a couple of extra commands to install the Ruby gems and the Pods. Navigate to the `ios` folder and run the following commands:

sh

```
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

The first command will install the Ruby dependencies and the second command will actually integrate the React Native code in your application so that your iOS files can import the React Native headers.

### 5. Writing the TypeScript Code

Now we will actually modify the native iOS application to integrate React Native.

The first bit of code we will write is the actual React Native code for the new screen that will be integrated into our application.

#### Create a `index.js` file

First, create an empty `index.js` file in the root of your React Native project.

`index.js` is the starting point for React Native applications, and it is always required. It can be a small file that `import`s other file that are part of your React Native component or application, or it can contain all the code that is needed for it.

Our `index.js` should look as follows (here the Community template file as reference):

js

```
import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
import App from './App';

AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorld', () => App);
```

#### Create a `App.tsx` file

Let's create an `App.tsx` file. This is a TypeScript file that can have JSX expressions. It contains the root React Native component that we will integrate into our iOS application (link):

```
import React from 'react';
import {
  SafeAreaView,
  ScrollView,
  StatusBar,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  useColorScheme,
  View,
} from 'react-native';

import {
  Colors,
  DebugInstructions,
  Header,
  ReloadInstructions,
} from 'react-native/Libraries/NewAppScreen';

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  const isDarkMode = useColorScheme() === 'dark';

  const backgroundStyle = {
    backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? Colors.darker : Colors.lighter,
  };

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={backgroundStyle}>
      <StatusBar
        barStyle={isDarkMode ? 'light-content' : 'dark-content'}
        backgroundColor={backgroundStyle.backgroundColor}
      />
      <ScrollView
        contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"
        style={backgroundStyle}>
        <Header />
        <View
          style={{
            backgroundColor: isDarkMode
              ? Colors.black
              : Colors.white,
            padding: 24,
          }}>
          <Text style={styles.title}>Step One</Text>
          <Text>
            Edit <Text style={styles.bold}>App.tsx</Text> to
            change this screen and see your edits.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.title}>See your changes</Text>
          <ReloadInstructions />
          <Text style={styles.title}>Debug</Text>
          <DebugInstructions />
        </View>
      </ScrollView>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: '600',
  },
  bold: {
    fontWeight: '700',
  },
});

export default App;
```

Here the Community template file as reference

### 5. Integrating with your iOS code

We now need to add some native code in order to start the React Native runtime and tell it to render our React components.

#### Requirements

React Native intialization is now unbound to any specific part of an iOS app.

React Native can be initialized using a class called `RCTReactNativeFactory`, that takes care of handling the React Native lifecycle for you.

Once the class is initialized, you can either start a React Native view providing a `UIWindow` object, or you can ask for the factory to generate a `UIView` that you can load in any `UIViewController.`

In the following example, we will create a ViewController that can load a React Native view as it's `view`.

##### Create the ReactViewController

Create a new file from template (`⌘`+`N`) and choose the Cocoa Touch Class template.

Make sure to select `UIViewController` as the "Subclass of" field.

- ObjectiveC
- Swift

Now open the `ReactViewController.m` file and apply the following changes

ReactViewController.m

```
#import "ReactViewController.h"
+#import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>
+#import <RCTReactNativeFactory.h>
+#import <RCTDefaultReactNativeFactoryDelegate.h>
+#import <RCTAppDependencyProvider.h>


@interface ReactViewController ()

@end

+@interface ReactNativeFactoryDelegate: RCTDefaultReactNativeFactoryDelegate
+@end

-@implementation ReactViewController
+@implementation ReactViewController {
+  RCTReactNativeFactory *_factory;
+  id<RCTReactNativeFactoryDelegate> _factoryDelegate;
+}

 - (void)viewDidLoad {
     [super viewDidLoad];
     // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
+    _factoryDelegate = [ReactNativeFactoryDelegate new];
+    _factoryDelegate.dependencyProvider = [RCTAppDependencyProvider new];
+    _factory = [[RCTReactNativeFactory alloc] initWithDelegate:_factoryDelegate];
+    self.view = [_factory.rootViewFactory viewWithModuleName:@"HelloWorld"];
 }

@end

+@implementation ReactNativeFactoryDelegate
+
+- (NSURL *)sourceURLForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge
+{
+  return [self bundleURL];
+}
+
+- (NSURL *)bundleURL
+{
+#if DEBUG
+  return [RCTBundleURLProvider.sharedSettings jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@"index"];
+#else
+  return [NSBundle.mainBundle URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];
+#endif
+}

@end
```

Now open the `ReactViewController.swift` file and apply the following changes

ReactViewController.swift

```
import UIKit
+import React
+import React_RCTAppDelegate
+import ReactAppDependencyProvider

class ReactViewController: UIViewController {
+  var reactNativeFactory: RCTReactNativeFactory?
+  var reactNativeFactoryDelegate: RCTReactNativeFactoryDelegate?

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
+    reactNativeFactoryDelegate = ReactNativeDelegate()
+    reactNativeFactoryDelegate!.dependencyProvider = RCTAppDependencyProvider()
+    reactNativeFactory = RCTReactNativeFactory(delegate: reactNativeFactoryDelegate!)
+    view = reactNativeFactory!.rootViewFactory.view(withModuleName: "HelloWorld")

  }
}

+class ReactNativeDelegate: RCTDefaultReactNativeFactoryDelegate {
+    override func sourceURL(for bridge: RCTBridge) -> URL? {
+      self.bundleURL()
+    }
+
+    override func bundleURL() -> URL? {
+      #if DEBUG
+      RCTBundleURLProvider.sharedSettings().jsBundleURL(forBundleRoot: "index")
+      #else
+      Bundle.main.url(forResource: "main", withExtension: "jsbundle")
+      #endif
+    }
+
+}
```

##### Presenting a React Native view in a rootViewController

Finally, we can present our React Native view. To do so, we need a new View Controller that can host a view in which we can load the JS content. We already have the initial `ViewController`, and we can make it present the `ReactViewController`. There are several ways to do so, depending on your app. For this example, we assume that you have a button that presents React Native modally.

- ObjectiveC
- Swift

ViewController.m

```
#import "ViewController.h"
+#import "ReactViewController.h"

@interface ViewController ()

@end

- @implementation ViewController
+@implementation ViewController {
+  ReactViewController *reactViewController;
+}

 - (void)viewDidLoad {
   [super viewDidLoad];
   // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
   self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemBackgroundColor;
+  UIButton *button = [UIButton new];
+  [button setTitle:@"Open React Native" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
+  [button setTitleColor:UIColor.systemBlueColor forState:UIControlStateNormal];
+  [button setTitleColor:UIColor.blueColor forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];
+  [button addTarget:self action:@selector(presentReactNative) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
+  [self.view addSubview:button];

+  button.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
+  [NSLayoutConstraint activateConstraints:@[
+    [button.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.leadingAnchor],
+    [button.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.trailingAnchor],
+    [button.centerYAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.centerYAnchor],
+    [button.centerXAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.centerXAnchor],
+  ]];
 }

+- (void)presentReactNative
+{
+  if (reactViewController == NULL) {
+    reactViewController = [ReactViewController new];
+  }
+  [self presentViewController:reactViewController animated:YES];
+}

@end
```

ViewController.swift

```
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

+  var reactViewController: ReactViewController?

  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    self.view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground

+    let button = UIButton()
+    button.setTitle("Open React Native", for: .normal)
+    button.setTitleColor(.systemBlue, for: .normal)
+    button.setTitleColor(.blue, for: .highlighted)
+    button.addAction(UIAction { [weak self] _ in
+      guard let self else { return }
+      if reactViewController == nil {
+       reactViewController = ReactViewController()
+      }
+      present(reactViewController!, animated: true)
+    }, for: .touchUpInside)
+    self.view.addSubview(button)
+
+    button.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
+    NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
+      button.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.leadingAnchor),
+      button.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.trailingAnchor),
+      button.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.centerXAnchor),
+      button.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.centerYAnchor),
+    ])
  }
}
```

Make sure to disable the Sandbox scripting. To achieve this, in Xcode, click on your app, then on build settings. Filter for script and set the `User Script Sandboxing` to `NO`. This step is needed to properly switch between the Debug and Release version of the Hermes engine that we ship with React Native.

Finally, make sure to add the `UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance` key into your `Info.plist` file, with value of `NO`.

### 6. Test your integration

You have completed all the basic steps to integrate React Native with your application. Now we will start the Metro bundler to build your TypeScript application code into a bundle. Metro's HTTP server shares the bundle from `localhost` on your developer environment to a simulator or device. This allows for hot reloading.

First, you need to create a `metro.config.js` file in the root of your project as follows:

js

```
const {getDefaultConfig} = require('@react-native/metro-config');
module.exports = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
```

You can checkout the metro.config.js file from the Community template file as reference.

Then, you need to create a `.watchmanconfig` file in the root of your project. The file must contain an empty json object:

sh

```
echo {} > .watchmanconfig
```

Once you have the configurations file in place, you can run the bundler. Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm start
```

shell

```
yarn start
```

Now build and run your iOS app as normal.

Once you reach your React-powered Activity inside the app, it should load the JavaScript code from the development server and display:

#### Creating a release build in Xcode

You can use Xcode to create your release builds too! The only additional step is to add a script that is executed when the app is built to package your JS and images into the iOS application.

1. In Xcode, select your application
2. Click on `Build Phases`
3. Click on the `+` in the top left corner and select `New Run Script Phase`
4. Click on the `Run Script` line and rename the Script to `Bundle React Native code and images`
5. Paste in the text box the following script

Build React Native code and image

```
set -e

WITH_ENVIRONMENT="$REACT_NATIVE_PATH/scripts/xcode/with-environment.sh"
REACT_NATIVE_XCODE="$REACT_NATIVE_PATH/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh"

/bin/sh -c "$WITH_ENVIRONMENT $REACT_NATIVE_XCODE"
```

6. Drag and drop the script before the one called `[CP] Embed Pods Frameworks`.

Now, if you build your app for Release, it will work as expected.

### 7. Passing initial props to the React Native view

In some case, you'd like to pass some information from the Native app to JavaScript. For example, you might want to pass the user id of the currently logged user to React Native, together with a token that can be used to retrieve information from a database.

This is possible by using the `initialProperties` parameter of the `view(withModuleName:initialProperty)` overload of the `RCTReactNativeFactory` class. The following steps shows you how to do it.

#### Update the App.tsx file to read the initial properties.

Open the `App.tsx` file and add the following code:

App.tsx

```
import {
  Colors,
  DebugInstructions,
  Header,
  ReloadInstructions,
} from 'react-native/Libraries/NewAppScreen';

-function App(): React.JSX.Element {
+function App(props): React.JSX.Element {
  const isDarkMode = useColorScheme() === 'dark';

  const backgroundStyle = {
    backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? Colors.darker : Colors.lighter,
  };

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={backgroundStyle}>
      <StatusBar
        barStyle={isDarkMode ? 'light-content' : 'dark-content'}
        backgroundColor={backgroundStyle.backgroundColor}
      />
      <ScrollView
        contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"
        style={backgroundStyle}>
        <Header />
-       <View
-         style={{
-           backgroundColor: isDarkMode
-             ? Colors.black
-             : Colors.white,
-           padding: 24,
-         }}>
-         <Text style={styles.title}>Step One</Text>
-         <Text>
-           Edit <Text style={styles.bold}>App.tsx</Text> to
-           change this screen and see your edits.
-         </Text>
-         <Text style={styles.title}>See your changes</Text>
-         <ReloadInstructions />
-         <Text style={styles.title}>Debug</Text>
-         <DebugInstructions />
+         <Text style={styles.title}>UserID: {props.userID}</Text>
+         <Text style={styles.title}>Token: {props.token}</Text>
        </View>
      </ScrollView>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: '600',
+   marginLeft: 20,
  },
  bold: {
    fontWeight: '700',
  },
});

export default App;
```

These changes will tell React Native that your App component is now accepting some properties. The `RCTreactNativeFactory` will take care of passing them to the component when it's rendered.

#### Update the Native code to pass the initial properties to JavaScript.

- ObjectiveC
- Swift

Modify the `ReactViewController.mm` to pass the initial properties to JavaScript.

ReactViewController.mm

```
 - (void)viewDidLoad {
   [super viewDidLoad];
   // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

   _factoryDelegate = [ReactNativeFactoryDelegate new];
   _factoryDelegate.dependencyProvider = [RCTAppDependencyProvider new];
   _factory = [[RCTReactNativeFactory alloc] initWithDelegate:_factoryDelegate];
-  self.view = [_factory.rootViewFactory viewWithModuleName:@"HelloWorld"];
+  self.view = [_factory.rootViewFactory viewWithModuleName:@"HelloWorld" initialProperties:@{
+    @"userID": @"12345678",
+    @"token": @"secretToken"
+  }];
}
```

Modify the `ReactViewController.swift` to pass the initial properties to the React Native view.

ReactViewController.swift

```
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    reactNativeFactoryDelegate = ReactNativeDelegate()
    reactNativeFactoryDelegate!.dependencyProvider = RCTAppDependencyProvider()
    reactNativeFactory = RCTReactNativeFactory(delegate: reactNativeFactoryDelegate!)
-   view = reactNativeFactory!.rootViewFactory.view(withModuleName: "HelloWorld")
+   view = reactNativeFactory!.rootViewFactory.view(withModuleName: "HelloWorld" initialProperties: [
+     "userID": "12345678",
+     "token": "secretToken"
+])

  }
}
```

3. Run your app once again. You should see the following screen after you present the `ReactViewController`:

### Now what?

At this point you can continue developing your app as usual. Refer to our debugging and deployment docs to learn more about working with React Native.

info

Native Module and Native Components are our stable technologies used by the legacy architecture. They will be deprecated in the future when the New Architecture will be stable. The New Architecture uses Turbo Native Module and Fabric Native Components to achieve similar results.

Native modules are usually distributed as npm packages, except that on top of the usual JavaScript they will include some native code per platform. To understand more about npm packages you may find this guide useful.

To get set up with the basic project structure for a native module we will use the community tool called create-react-native-library. You can go ahead further and dive deep into how that library works, but for our needs we will only execute the basic script:

shell

```
npx create-react-native-library@latest react-native-awesome-module
```

Where `react-native-awesome-module` is the name you would like for the new module. After doing this you will navigate into `react-native-awesome-module` folder and bootstrap the example project by running:

shell

```
yarn
```

When the bootstrap is done, you will be able to start the example app by executing one of the following commands:

shell

```
# Android app
yarn example android
# iOS app
yarn example ios
```

When all steps above are done, you will be able to continue with Android Native Modules or iOS Native Modules guides to add in some code.

## Local libraries setup

A local library is a library containing views or modules that's local to your app and not published to a registry. This is different from the traditional setup for view and modules in the sense that a local library is decoupled from your app's native code.

The local library is created outside of the `android/` and `ios/` folders and makes use of autolinking to integrate with your app. The structure with a local library may look like this:

plaintext

```
MyApp
├── node_modules
├── modules <-- folder for your local libraries
│ └── awesome-module <-- your local library
├── android
├── ios
├── src
├── index.js
└── package.json
```

Since a local library's code exists outside of `android/` and `ios/` folders, it makes it easier to upgrade React Native versions in the future, copy to other projects etc.

To create local library we will use create-react-native-library. This tool contains all the necessary templates.

#### Getting Started

Inside your React Native application's root folder, run the following command:

shell

```
npx create-react-native-library@latest awesome-module
```

Where `awesome-module` is the name you would like for the new module. After going through the prompts, you will have a new folder called `modules` in your project's root directory which contains the new module.

#### Linking

By default, the generated library is automatically linked to the project using `link:` protocol when using Yarn and `file:` when using npm:

- npm
- Yarn

json

```
"dependencies": {
  "awesome-module": "file:./modules/awesome-module"
}
```

json

```
"dependencies": {
  "awesome-module": "link:./modules/awesome-module"
}
```

This creates a symlink to the library under `node_modules` which makes autolinking work.

#### Installing dependencies

To link the module you need to install dependencies:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm install
```

shell

```
yarn install
```

#### Using module inside your app

To use the module inside your app, you can import it by its name:

js

```
import {multiply} from 'awesome-module';
```

## iOS Native UI Components

info

Native Module and Native Components are our stable technologies used by the legacy architecture. They will be deprecated in the future when the New Architecture will be stable. The New Architecture uses Turbo Native Module and Fabric Native Components to achieve similar results.

There are tons of native UI widgets out there ready to be used in the latest apps - some of them are part of the platform, others are available as third-party libraries, and still more might be in use in your very own portfolio. React Native has several of the most critical platform components already wrapped, like `ScrollView` and `TextInput`, but not all of them, and certainly not ones you might have written yourself for a previous app. Fortunately, we can wrap up these existing components for seamless integration with your React Native application.

Like the native module guide, this too is a more advanced guide that assumes you are somewhat familiar with iOS programming. This guide will show you how to build a native UI component, walking you through the implementation of a subset of the existing `MapView` component available in the core React Native library.

### iOS MapView example

Let's say we want to add an interactive Map to our app - might as well use `MKMapView`, we only need to make it usable from JavaScript.

Native views are created and manipulated by subclasses of `RCTViewManager`. These subclasses are similar in function to view controllers, but are essentially singletons - only one instance of each is created by the bridge. They expose native views to the `RCTUIManager`, which delegates back to them to set and update the properties of the views as necessary. The `RCTViewManager`s are also typically the delegates for the views, sending events back to JavaScript via the bridge.

To expose a view you can:

- Subclass `RCTViewManager` to create a manager for your component.
- Add the `RCT_EXPORT_MODULE()` marker macro.
- Implement the `-(UIView *)view` method.

RNTMapManager.m

```
#import <MapKit/MapKit.h>

#import <React/RCTViewManager.h>

@interface RNTMapManager : RCTViewManager
@end

@implementation RNTMapManager

RCT_EXPORT_MODULE(RNTMap)

- (UIView *)view
{
  return [[MKMapView alloc] init];
}

@end
```

note

Do not attempt to set the `frame` or `backgroundColor` properties on the `UIView` instance that you expose through the `-view` method. React Native will overwrite the values set by your custom class in order to match your JavaScript component's layout props. If you need this granularity of control it might be better to wrap the `UIView` instance you want to style in another `UIView` and return the wrapper `UIView` instead. See Issue 2948 for more context.

info

In the example above, we prefixed our class name with `RNT`. Prefixes are used to avoid name collisions with other frameworks. Apple frameworks use two-letter prefixes, and React Native uses `RCT` as a prefix. In order to avoid name collisions, we recommend using a three-letter prefix other than `RCT` in your own classes.

Then you need a little bit of JavaScript to make this a usable React component:

MapView\.tsx

```
import {requireNativeComponent} from 'react-native';

export default requireNativeComponent('RNTMap');
```

The `requireNativeComponent` function automatically resolves `RNTMap` to `RNTMapManager` and exports our native view for use in JavaScript.

MyApp.tsx

```
import MapView from './MapView.tsx';

export default function MyApp() {
  return <MapView style={{flex: 1}} />;
}
```

note

When rendering, don't forget to stretch the view, otherwise you'll be staring at a blank screen.

This is now a fully-functioning native map view component in JavaScript, complete with pinch-zoom and other native gesture support. We can't really control it from JavaScript yet, though.

### Properties

The first thing we can do to make this component more usable is to bridge over some native properties. Let's say we want to be able to disable zooming and specify the visible region. Disabling zoom is a boolean, so we add this one line:

RNTMapManager.m

```
RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(zoomEnabled, BOOL)
```

Note that we explicitly specify the type as `BOOL` - React Native uses `RCTConvert` under the hood to convert all sorts of different data types when talking over the bridge, and bad values will show convenient "RedBox" errors to let you know there is an issue ASAP. When things are straightforward like this, the whole implementation is taken care of for you by this macro.

Now to actually disable zooming, we set the property in JavaScript:

MyApp.tsx

```
import MapView from './MapView.tsx';

export default function MyApp() {
  return <MapView zoomEnabled={false} style={{flex: 1}} />;
}
```

To document the properties (and which values they accept) of our MapView component we'll add a wrapper component and document the interface with TypeScript:

MapView\.tsx

```
import {requireNativeComponent} from 'react-native';

const RNTMap = requireNativeComponent('RNTMap');

export default function MapView(props: {
  /**
   * Whether the user may use pinch gestures to zoom in and out.
   */
  zoomEnabled?: boolean;
}) {
  return <RNTMap {...props} />;
}
```

Now we have a nicely documented wrapper component to work with.

Next, let's add the more complex `region` prop. We start by adding the native code:

RNTMapManager.m

```
RCT_CUSTOM_VIEW_PROPERTY(region, MKCoordinateRegion, MKMapView)
{
  [view setRegion:json ? [RCTConvert MKCoordinateRegion:json] : defaultView.region animated:YES];
}
```

Ok, this is more complicated than the `BOOL` case we had before. Now we have a `MKCoordinateRegion` type that needs a conversion function, and we have custom code so that the view will animate when we set the region from JS. Within the function body that we provide, `json` refers to the raw value that has been passed from JS. There is also a `view` variable which gives us access to the manager's view instance, and a `defaultView` that we use to reset the property back to the default value if JS sends us a null sentinel.

You could write any conversion function you want for your view - here is the implementation for `MKCoordinateRegion` via a category on `RCTConvert`. It uses an already existing category of ReactNative `RCTConvert+CoreLocation`:

RNTMapManager.m

```
#import "RCTConvert+Mapkit.h"
```

RCTConvert+Mapkit.h

```
#import <MapKit/MapKit.h>
#import <React/RCTConvert.h>
#import <CoreLocation/CoreLocation.h>
#import <React/RCTConvert+CoreLocation.h>

@interface RCTConvert (Mapkit)

+ (MKCoordinateSpan)MKCoordinateSpan:(id)json;
+ (MKCoordinateRegion)MKCoordinateRegion:(id)json;

@end

@implementation RCTConvert(MapKit)

+ (MKCoordinateSpan)MKCoordinateSpan:(id)json
{
  json = [self NSDictionary:json];
  return (MKCoordinateSpan){
    [self CLLocationDegrees:json[@"latitudeDelta"]],
    [self CLLocationDegrees:json[@"longitudeDelta"]]
  };
}

+ (MKCoordinateRegion)MKCoordinateRegion:(id)json
{
  return (MKCoordinateRegion){
    [self CLLocationCoordinate2D:json],
    [self MKCoordinateSpan:json]
  };
}

@end
```

These conversion functions are designed to safely process any JSON that the JS might throw at them by displaying "RedBox" errors and returning standard initialization values when missing keys or other developer errors are encountered.

To finish up support for the `region` prop, we can document it with TypeScript:

MapView\.tsx

```
import {requireNativeComponent} from 'react-native';

const RNTMap = requireNativeComponent('RNTMap');

export default function MapView(props: {
  /**
   * The region to be displayed by the map.
   *
   * The region is defined by the center coordinates and the span of
   * coordinates to display.
   */
  region?: {
    /**
     * Coordinates for the center of the map.
     */
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;

    /**
     * Distance between the minimum and the maximum latitude/longitude
     * to be displayed.
     */
    latitudeDelta: number;
    longitudeDelta: number;
  };
  /**
   * Whether the user may use pinch gestures to zoom in and out.
   */
  zoomEnabled?: boolean;
}) {
  return <RNTMap {...props} />;
}
```

We can now supply the `region` prop to `MapView`:

MyApp.tsx

```
import MapView from './MapView.tsx';

export default function MyApp() {
  const region = {
    latitude: 37.48,
    longitude: -122.16,
    latitudeDelta: 0.1,
    longitudeDelta: 0.1,
  };
  return (
    <MapView
      region={region}
      zoomEnabled={false}
      style={{flex: 1}}
    />
  );
}
```

### Events

So now we have a native map component that we can control freely from JS, but how do we deal with events from the user, like pinch-zooms or panning to change the visible region?

Until now we've only returned a `MKMapView` instance from our manager's `-(UIView *)view` method. We can't add new properties to `MKMapView` so we have to create a new subclass from `MKMapView` which we use for our View. We can then add a `onRegionChange` callback on this subclass:

RNTMapView\.h

```
#import <MapKit/MapKit.h>

#import <React/RCTComponent.h>

@interface RNTMapView: MKMapView

@property (nonatomic, copy) RCTBubblingEventBlock onRegionChange;

@end
```

RNTMapView\.m

```
#import "RNTMapView.h"

@implementation RNTMapView

@end
```

Note that all `RCTBubblingEventBlock` must be prefixed with `on`. Next, declare an event handler property on `RNTMapManager`, make it a delegate for all the views it exposes, and forward events to JS by calling the event handler block from the native view.

RNTMapManager.m

```
#import <MapKit/MapKit.h>
#import <React/RCTViewManager.h>

#import "RNTMapView.h"
#import "RCTConvert+Mapkit.h"

@interface RNTMapManager : RCTViewManager <MKMapViewDelegate>
@end

@implementation RNTMapManager

RCT_EXPORT_MODULE()

RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(zoomEnabled, BOOL)
RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(onRegionChange, RCTBubblingEventBlock)

RCT_CUSTOM_VIEW_PROPERTY(region, MKCoordinateRegion, MKMapView)
{
  [view setRegion:json ? [RCTConvert MKCoordinateRegion:json] : defaultView.region animated:YES];
}

- (UIView *)view
{
  RNTMapView *map = [RNTMapView new];
  map.delegate = self;
  return map;
}

#pragma mark MKMapViewDelegate

- (void)mapView:(RNTMapView *)mapView regionDidChangeAnimated:(BOOL)animated
{
  if (!mapView.onRegionChange) {
    return;
  }

  MKCoordinateRegion region = mapView.region;
  mapView.onRegionChange(@{
    @"region": @{
      @"latitude": @(region.center.latitude),
      @"longitude": @(region.center.longitude),
      @"latitudeDelta": @(region.span.latitudeDelta),
      @"longitudeDelta": @(region.span.longitudeDelta),
    }
  });
}
@end
```

In the delegate method `-mapView:regionDidChangeAnimated:` the event handler block is called on the corresponding view with the region data. Calling the `onRegionChange` event handler block results in calling the same callback prop in JavaScript. This callback is invoked with the raw event, which we typically process in the wrapper component to simplify the API:

MapView\.tsx

```
// ...

type RegionChangeEvent = {
  nativeEvent: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    latitudeDelta: number;
    longitudeDelta: number;
  };
};

export default function MapView(props: {
  // ...
  /**
   * Callback that is called continuously when the user is dragging the map.
   */
  onRegionChange: (event: RegionChangeEvent) => unknown;
}) {
  return <RNTMap {...props} onRegionChange={onRegionChange} />;
}
```

MyApp.tsx

```
import MapView from './MapView.tsx';

export default function MyApp() {
  // ...

  const onRegionChange = useCallback(event => {
    const {region} = event.nativeEvent;
    // Do something with `region.latitude`, etc.
  });

  return (
    <MapView
      // ...
      onRegionChange={onRegionChange}
    />
  );
}
```

### Handling multiple native views

A React Native view can have more than one child view in the view tree eg.

```
<View>
  <MyNativeView />
  <MyNativeView />
  <Button />
</View>
```

In this example, the class `MyNativeView` is a wrapper for a `NativeComponent` and exposes methods, which will be called on the iOS platform. `MyNativeView` is defined in `MyNativeView.ios.js` and contains proxy methods of `NativeComponent`.

When the user interacts with the component, like clicking the button, the `backgroundColor` of `MyNativeView` changes. In this case `UIManager` would not know which `MyNativeView` should be handled and which one should change `backgroundColor`. Below you will find a solution to this problem:

```
<View>
  <MyNativeView ref={this.myNativeReference} />
  <MyNativeView ref={this.myNativeReference2} />
  <Button
    onPress={() => {
      this.myNativeReference.callNativeMethod();
    }}
  />
</View>
```

Now the above component has a reference to a particular `MyNativeView` which allows us to use a specific instance of `MyNativeView`. Now the button can control which `MyNativeView` should change its `backgroundColor`. In this example let's assume that `callNativeMethod` changes `backgroundColor`.

MyNativeView\.ios.tsx

```
class MyNativeView extends React.Component {
  callNativeMethod = () => {
    UIManager.dispatchViewManagerCommand(
      ReactNative.findNodeHandle(this),
      UIManager.getViewManagerConfig('RNCMyNativeView').Commands
        .callNativeMethod,
      [],
    );
  };

  render() {
    return <NativeComponent ref={NATIVE_COMPONENT_REF} />;
  }
}
```

`callNativeMethod` is our custom iOS method which for example changes the `backgroundColor` which is exposed through `MyNativeView`. This method uses `UIManager.dispatchViewManagerCommand` which needs 3 parameters:

- `(nonnull NSNumber \*)reactTag`  -  id of react view.
- `commandID:(NSInteger)commandID`  -  Id of the native method that should be called
- `commandArgs:(NSArray<id> \*)commandArgs`  -  Args of the native method that we can pass from JS to native.

RNCMyNativeViewManager.m

```
#import <React/RCTViewManager.h>
#import <React/RCTUIManager.h>
#import <React/RCTLog.h>

RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(callNativeMethod:(nonnull NSNumber*) reactTag) {
    [self.bridge.uiManager addUIBlock:^(RCTUIManager *uiManager, NSDictionary<NSNumber *,UIView *> *viewRegistry) {
        NativeView *view = viewRegistry[reactTag];
        if (!view || ![view isKindOfClass:[NativeView class]]) {
            RCTLogError(@"Cannot find NativeView with tag #%@", reactTag);
            return;
        }
        [view callNativeMethod];
    }];

}
```

Here the `callNativeMethod` is defined in the `RNCMyNativeViewManager.m` file and contains only one parameter which is `(nonnull NSNumber*) reactTag`. This exported function will find a particular view using `addUIBlock` which contains the `viewRegistry` parameter and returns the component based on `reactTag` allowing it to call the method on the correct component.

### Styles

Since all our native react views are subclasses of `UIView`, most style attributes will work like you would expect out of the box. Some components will want a default style, however, for example `UIDatePicker` which is a fixed size. This default style is important for the layout algorithm to work as expected, but we also want to be able to override the default style when using the component. `DatePickerIOS` does this by wrapping the native component in an extra view, which has flexible styling, and using a fixed style (which is generated with constants passed in from native) on the inner native component:

DatePickerIOS.ios.tsx

```
import {UIManager} from 'react-native';
const RCTDatePickerIOSConsts = UIManager.RCTDatePicker.Constants;
...
  render: function() {
    return (
      <View style={this.props.style}>
        <RCTDatePickerIOS
          ref={DATEPICKER}
          style={styles.rkDatePickerIOS}
          ...
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
});

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  rkDatePickerIOS: {
    height: RCTDatePickerIOSConsts.ComponentHeight,
    width: RCTDatePickerIOSConsts.ComponentWidth,
  },
});
```

The `RCTDatePickerIOSConsts` constants are exported from native by grabbing the actual frame of the native component like so:

RCTDatePickerManager.m

```
- (NSDictionary *)constantsToExport
{
  UIDatePicker *dp = [[UIDatePicker alloc] init];
  [dp layoutIfNeeded];

  return @{
    @"ComponentHeight": @(CGRectGetHeight(dp.frame)),
    @"ComponentWidth": @(CGRectGetWidth(dp.frame)),
    @"DatePickerModes": @{
      @"time": @(UIDatePickerModeTime),
      @"date": @(UIDatePickerModeDate),
      @"datetime": @(UIDatePickerModeDateAndTime),
    }
  };
}
```

This guide covered many of the aspects of bridging over custom native components, but there is even more you might need to consider, such as custom hooks for inserting and laying out subviews. If you want to go even deeper, check out the source code of some of the implemented components.

The guide for Integration with Existing Apps details how to integrate a full-screen React Native app into an existing Android app as an **Activity**.

To use React Native components within **Fragments** in an existing app requires some additional setup.

## 1. Add React Native to your app

Follow the guide for Integration with Existing Apps until the end to make sure you can safely run your React Native app in a full screen Activity.

#### 2. Add a FrameLayout for the React Native Fragment

In this example, we're going to use a `FrameLayout` to add a React Native Fragment to an Activity. This approach is flexible enough and can be adapted to use React Native in other layouts such as Bottom Sheets or Tab Layouts.

First add a `<FrameLayout>` with an id, width and height to your Activity's layout (e.g. `main_activity.xml` in the `res/layouts` folder). This is the layout you will find to render your React Native Fragment.

xml

```
<FrameLayout
    android:id="@+id/react_native_fragment"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

#### 3. Make your host Activity implement `DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler`

As your host activity is not a `ReactActivity`, you need to implement the `DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler` interface to handle the back button press event. This is required by React Native to handle the back button press event.

Go into your host activity and make sure it implements the `DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler` interface:

- Java
- Kotlin

diff

```
package <your-package-here>

import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
+import com.facebook.react.modules.core.DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler

+class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
+class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.main_activity)

        findViewById<Button>(R.id.sample_button).setOnClickListener {
            // Handle button click
        }
    }

+   override fun invokeDefaultOnBackPressed() {
+       super.onBackPressed()
+   }
}
```

diff

```
package <your-package-here>;

import android.os.Bundle;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
+import com.facebook.react.modules.core.DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler;

-class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
+class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main_activity);

        findViewById(R.id.button_appcompose).setOnClickListener(button -> {
            // Handle button click
        });
    }

+   @Override
+   public void invokeDefaultOnBackPressed() {
+       super.onBackPressed();
+   }
}
```

#### 4. Add a React Native Fragment to the FrameLayout

Finally, we can update the Activity to add a React Native Fragment to the FrameLayout. In this specific example, we're going to assume that your Activity has a button with id `sample_button` that when clicked will render a React Native Fragment into the FrameLayout.

Update your Activity's `onCreate` method as follows:

- Java
- Kotlin

diff

```
package <your-package-here>

import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
+import com.facebook.react.ReactFragment
import com.facebook.react.modules.core.DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler

public class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.main_activity)

        findViewById<Button>(R.id.sample_button).setOnClickListener {
+           val reactNativeFragment = ReactFragment.Builder()
+               .setComponentName("HelloWorld")
+               .setLaunchOptions(Bundle().apply { putString("message", "my value") })
+               .build()
+           supportFragmentManager
+               .beginTransaction()
+               .add(R.id.react_native_fragment, reactNativeFragment)
+               .commit()
        }
    }

   override fun invokeDefaultOnBackPressed() {
       super.onBackPressed()
   }
}
```

diff

```
package <your-package-here>;

import android.os.Bundle;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
+import com.facebook.react.ReactFragment;
import com.facebook.react.modules.core.DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main_activity);

        findViewById(R.id.button_appcompose).setOnClickListener(button -> {
+           Bundle launchOptions = new Bundle();
+           launchOptions.putString("message", "my value");
+
+           ReactFragment fragment = new ReactFragment.Builder()
+                   .setComponentName("HelloWorld")
+                   .setLaunchOptions(launchOptions)
+                   .build();
+           getSupportFragmentManager()
+                   .beginTransaction()
+                   .add(R.id.react_native_fragment, fragment)
+                   .commit();
        });
    }

    @Override
    public void invokeDefaultOnBackPressed() {
        super.onBackPressed();
    }
}
```

Let's look at the code above.

The `ReactFragment.Builder()` is used to create a new `ReactFragment` and then we use the `supportFragmentManager` to add that Fragment to the `FrameLayout`.

Inside the builder you can customize how the fragment is created:

- `setComponentName` is the name of the component you want to render. It's the same string specified in your `index.js` inside the `registerComponent` method.
- `setLaunchOptions` is an optional method to pass initial props to your component. This is optional and you can remove it if you don't use it.

#### 5. Test your integration

Make sure you run `yarn start` to run the bundler and then run your android app in Android Studio. The app should load the JavaScript/TypeScript code from the development server and display it in your React Native Fragment in the Activity.

Your app should look like this one:

## Building For TV Devices

TV devices support has been implemented with the intention of making existing React Native applications work on Apple TV and Android TV, with few or no changes needed in the JavaScript code for the applications.

> **Deprecated.** TV support has moved to the React Native for TV repository. Please see the _README_ there for information on projects for Apple TV or Android TV.

## Direct Manipulation

It is sometimes necessary to make changes directly to a component without using state/props to trigger a re-render of the entire subtree. When using React in the browser for example, you sometimes need to directly modify a DOM node, and the same is true for views in mobile apps. `setNativeProps` is the React Native equivalent to setting properties directly on a DOM node.

caution

Use `setNativeProps` when frequent re-rendering creates a performance bottleneck!

Direct manipulation will not be a tool that you reach for frequently. You will typically only be using it for creating continuous animations to avoid the overhead of rendering the component hierarchy and reconciling many views. `setNativeProps` is imperative and stores state in the native layer (DOM, UIView, etc.) and not within your React components, which makes your code more difficult to reason about.

Before you use it, try to solve your problem with `setState` and `shouldComponentUpdate`.

### setNativeProps with TouchableOpacity

TouchableOpacity uses `setNativeProps` internally to update the opacity of its child component:

```
const viewRef = useRef<View>();
const setOpacityTo = useCallback(value => {
  // Redacted: animation related code
  viewRef.current.setNativeProps({
    opacity: value,
  });
}, []);
```

This allows us to write the following code and know that the child will have its opacity updated in response to taps, without the child having any knowledge of that fact or requiring any changes to its implementation:

```
<TouchableOpacity onPress={handlePress}>
  <View>
    <Text>Press me!</Text>
  </View>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

Let's imagine that `setNativeProps` was not available. One way that we might implement it with that constraint is to store the opacity value in the state, then update that value whenever `onPress` is fired:

```
const [buttonOpacity, setButtonOpacity] = useState(1);
return (
  <TouchableOpacity
    onPressIn={() => setButtonOpacity(0.5)}
    onPressOut={() => setButtonOpacity(1)}>
    <View style={{opacity: buttonOpacity}}>
      <Text>Press me!</Text>
    </View>
  </TouchableOpacity>
);
```

This is computationally intensive compared to the original example - React needs to re-render the component hierarchy each time the opacity changes, even though other properties of the view and its children haven't changed. Usually this overhead isn't a concern but when performing continuous animations and responding to gestures, judiciously optimizing your components can improve your animations' fidelity.

If you look at the implementation of `setNativeProps` in NativeMethodsMixin you will notice that it is a wrapper around `RCTUIManager.updateView` - this is the exact same function call that results from re-rendering - see receiveComponent in ReactNativeBaseComponent.

### Composite components and setNativeProps

Composite components are not backed by a native view, so you cannot call `setNativeProps` on them. Consider this example:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

If you run this you will immediately see this error: `Touchable child must either be native or forward setNativeProps to a native component`. This occurs because `MyButton` isn't directly backed by a native view whose opacity should be set. You can think about it like this: if you define a component with `createReactClass` you would not expect to be able to set a style prop on it and have that work - you would need to pass the style prop down to a child, unless you are wrapping a native component. Similarly, we are going to forward `setNativeProps` to a native-backed child component.

##### Forward setNativeProps to a child

Since the `setNativeProps` method exists on any ref to a `View` component, it is enough to forward a ref on your custom component to one of the `<View />` components that it renders. This means that a call to `setNativeProps` on the custom component will have the same effect as if you called `setNativeProps` on the wrapped `View` component itself.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

You can now use `MyButton` inside of `TouchableOpacity`!

You may have noticed that we passed all of the props down to the child view using `{...props}`. The reason for this is that `TouchableOpacity` is actually a composite component, and so in addition to depending on `setNativeProps` on its child, it also requires that the child perform touch handling. To do this, it passes on various props that call back to the `TouchableOpacity` component. `TouchableHighlight`, in contrast, is backed by a native view and only requires that we implement `setNativeProps`.

### setNativeProps to edit TextInput value

Another very common use case of `setNativeProps` is to edit the value of the TextInput. The `controlled` prop of TextInput can sometimes drop characters when the `bufferDelay` is low and the user types very quickly. Some developers prefer to skip this prop entirely and instead use `setNativeProps` to directly manipulate the TextInput value when necessary. For example, the following code demonstrates editing the input when you tap a button:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

You can use the `clear` method to clear the `TextInput` which clears the current input text using the same approach.

### Avoiding conflicts with the render function

If you update a property that is also managed by the render function, you might end up with some unpredictable and confusing bugs because anytime the component re-renders and that property changes, whatever value was previously set from `setNativeProps` will be completely ignored and overridden.

### setNativeProps & shouldComponentUpdate

By intelligently applying `shouldComponentUpdate` you can avoid the unnecessary overhead involved in reconciling unchanged component subtrees, to the point where it may be performant enough to use `setState` instead of `setNativeProps`.

### Other native methods

The methods described here are available on most of the default components provided by React Native. Note, however, that they are _not_ available on composite components that aren't directly backed by a native view. This will generally include most components that you define in your own app.

#### measure(callback)

Determines the location on screen, width, and height in the viewport of the given view and returns the values via an async callback. If successful, the callback will be called with the following arguments:

- x
- y
- width
- height
- pageX
- pageY

Note that these measurements are not available until after the rendering has been completed in native. If you need the measurements as soon as possible and you don't need `pageX` and `pageY`, consider using the `onLayout` property instead.

Also the width and height returned by `measure()` are the width and height of the component in the viewport. If you need the actual size of the component, consider using the `onLayout` property instead.

#### measureInWindow(callback)

Determines the location of the given view in the window and returns the values via an async callback. If the React root view is embedded in another native view, this will give you the absolute coordinates. If successful, the callback will be called with the following arguments:

- x
- y
- width
- height

#### measureLayout(relativeToNativeComponentRef, onSuccess, onFail)

Like `measure()`, but measures the view relative to an ancestor, specified with `relativeToNativeComponentRef` reference. This means that the returned coordinates are relative to the origin `x`, `y` of the ancestor view.

note

This method can also be called with a `relativeToNativeNode` handler (instead of reference), but this variant is obsolete with the new architecture.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

#### focus()

Requests focus for the given input or view. The exact behavior triggered will depend on the platform and type of view.

#### blur()

Removes focus from an input or view. This is the opposite of `focus()`.

## View

The most fundamental component for building a UI, `View` is a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls. `View` maps directly to the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a `UIView`, `<div>`, `android.view`, etc.

`View` is designed to be nested inside other views and can have 0 to many children of any type.

This example creates a `View` that wraps two boxes with color and a text component in a row with padding.

> `View`s are designed to be used with `StyleSheet` for clarity and performance, although inline styles are also supported.

#### Synthetic Touch Events

For `View` responder props (e.g., `onResponderMove`), the synthetic touch event passed to them are in form of PressEvent.

#### `accessibilityRole`

`accessibilityRole` communicates the purpose of a component to the user of an assistive technology.

`accessibilityRole` can be one of the following:

- `'none'` - Used when the element has no role.
- `'button'` - Used when the element should be treated as a button.
- `'link'` - Used when the element should be treated as a link.
- `'search'` - Used when the text field element should also be treated as a search field.
- `'image'` - Used when the element should be treated as an image. Can be combined with button or link, for example.
- `'keyboardkey'` - Used when the element acts as a keyboard key.
- `'text'` - Used when the element should be treated as static text that cannot change.
- `'adjustable'` - Used when an element can be "adjusted" (e.g. a slider).
- `'imagebutton'` - Used when the element should be treated as a button and is also an image.
- `'header'` - Used when an element acts as a header for a content section (e.g. the title of a navigation bar).
- `'summary'` - Used when an element can be used to provide a quick summary of current conditions in the app when the app first launches.
- `'alert'` - Used when an element contains important text to be presented to the user.
- `'checkbox'` - Used when an element represents a checkbox which can be checked, unchecked, or have mixed checked state.
- `'combobox'` - Used when an element represents a combo box, which allows the user to select among several choices.
- `'menu'` - Used when the component is a menu of choices.

</View>
```

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

#### `collapsable`

Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization. Set this property to `false` to disable this optimization and ensure that this `View` exists in the native view hierarchy.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | true    |

---

#### `collapsableChildren`

Setting to false prevents direct children of the view from being removed from the native view hierarchy, similar to the effect of setting `collapsable={false}` on each child.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | true    |

---

#### `focusable`Android

Whether this `View` should be focusable with a non-touch input device, eg. receive focus with a hardware keyboard.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `hitSlop`

This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view. Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least 30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels.

For example, if a touchable view has a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with `hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}`

> The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views.

| Type                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| object: `{top: number, left: number, bottom: number, right: number}` |

---

#### `id`

Used to locate this view from native classes. Has precedence over `nativeID` prop.

> This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

#### `importantForAccessibility`Android

Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen. Works for Android only.

Possible values:

- `'auto'` - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
- `'yes'` - The view is important for accessibility.
- `'no'` - The view is not important for accessibility.
- `'no-hide-descendants'` - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.

See the Android `importantForAccessibility` docs for reference.

| Type                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ |
| enum('auto', 'yes', 'no', 'no-hide-descendants') |

---

#### `nativeID`

Used to locate this view from native classes.

> This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

#### `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`

Whether this `View` needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (`false`) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the `View` you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping `View`s, or text and a background).

Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view **contents** are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

When `accessible` is `true`, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the escape gesture.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `onAccessibilityTap`iOS

When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `onLayout`

Invoked on mount and on layout changes.

This event is fired immediately once the layout has been calculated, but the new layout may not yet be reflected on the screen at the time the event is received, especially if a layout animation is in progress.

Does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness? This is called for every touch move on the `View` when it is not the responder.

| Type                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `({nativeEvent: PressEvent}) => boolean` |

---

If a parent `View` wants to prevent a child `View` from becoming responder on a move, it should have this handler which returns `true`.

| Type                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `({nativeEvent: PressEvent}) => boolean` |

---

#### `onResponderGrant`

The View is now responding for touch events. This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening.

On Android, return true from this callback to prevent any other native components from becoming responder until this responder terminates.

| Type                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ |

Another responder is already active and will not release it to that `View` asking to be the responder.

| Type                                  |
| ------------------------------------- |
| `({nativeEvent: PressEvent}) => void` |

---

#### `onResponderRelease`

Fired at the end of the touch.

| Type                                  |
| ------------------------------------- |
| `({nativeEvent: PressEvent}) => void` |

---

#### `onResponderTerminate`

The responder has been taken from the `View`. Might be taken by other views after a call to `onResponderTerminationRequest`, or might be taken by the OS without asking (e.g., happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)

| Type                                  |
| ------------------------------------- |
| `({nativeEvent: PressEvent}) => void` |

---

#### `onResponderTerminationRequest`

Some other `View` wants to become responder and is asking this `View` to release its responder. Returning `true` allows its release.

| Type                                  |
| ------------------------------------- |
| `({nativeEvent: PressEvent}) => void` |

---

#### `onStartShouldSetResponder`

| ---------------------------------------- |
| `({nativeEvent: PressEvent}) => boolean` |

---

#### `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`

If a parent `View` wants to prevent a child `View` from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have this handler which returns `true`.

| Type                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `({nativeEvent: PressEvent}) => boolean` |

---

#### `pointerEvents`

Controls whether the `View` can be the target of touch events.

- `'auto'`: The View can be the target of touch events.
- `'none'`: The View is never the target of touch events.
- `'box-none'`: The View is never the target of touch events but its subviews can be. It behaves like if the view had the following classes in CSS:

css

```
.box-none {
  pointer-events: none;
}
.box-none * {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
```

- `'box-only'`: The view can be the target of touch events but its subviews cannot be. It behaves like if the view had the following classes in CSS:

css

```
.box-only {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
.box-only * {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

| Type                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- |
| enum('box-none', 'none', 'box-only', 'auto') |

---

#### `removeClippedSubviews`

This is a reserved performance property exposed by `RCTView` and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews, most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound. The subviews must also have `overflow: hidden`, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

#### `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`Android

Whether this `View` should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.

On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale: in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can be re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

#### `role`

`role` communicates the purpose of a component to the user of an assistive technology. Has precedence over the `accessibilityRole` prop.

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `shouldRasterizeIOS`iOS

Whether this `View` should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.

On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children; for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view and quickly composite it during each frame.

Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory. Test and measure when using this property.

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

#### `style`

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `tabIndex`Android

Whether this `View` should be focusable with a non-touch input device, eg. receive focus with a hardware keyboard. Supports the following values:

- `0` - View is focusable
- `-1` - View is not focusable

| Type        |
| ----------- |
| enum(0, -1) |

---

#### `testID`

Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.

> This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

## Out-of-Tree Platforms

React Native is not only for Android and iOS devices - our partners and the community maintain projects that bring React Native to other platforms, such as:

**From Partners**

- React Native macOS - React Native for macOS and Cocoa.
- React Native Windows - React Native for Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
- React Native visionOS - React Native for Apple's visionOS.

**From Community**

- React Native tvOS - React Native for Apple TV and Android TV devices.
- React Native Web - React Native on the web using React DOM.
- React Native Skia - React Native using Skia as a renderer. Currently supports Linux and macOS.

### Creating your own React Native platform

Right now the process of creating a React Native platform from scratch is not very well documented - one of the goals of the upcoming re-architecture (Fabric) is to make maintaining a platform easier.

#### Bundling

As of React Native 0.57 you can now register your React Native platform with React Native's JavaScript bundler, Metro. This means you can pass `--platform example` to `npx react-native bundle`, and it will look for JavaScript files with the `.example.js` suffix.

To register your platform with RNPM, your module's name must match one of these patterns:

- `react-native-example` - It will search all top-level modules that start with `react-native-`
- `@org/react-native-example` - It will search for modules that start with `react-native-` under any scope
- `@react-native-example/module` - It will search in all modules under scopes with names starting with `@react-native-`

You must also have an entry in your `package.json` like this:

json

```
{
  "rnpm": {
    "haste": {
      "providesModuleNodeModules": ["react-native-example"],
      "platforms": ["example"]
    }
  }
}
```

`"providesModuleNodeModules"` is an array of modules that will get added to the Haste module search path, and `"platforms"` is an array of platform suffixes that will be added as valid platforms.

## Animated

The `Animated` library is designed to make animations fluid, powerful, and painless to build and maintain. `Animated` focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, configurable transforms in between, and `start`/`stop` methods to control time-based animation execution.

The core workflow for creating an animation is to create an `Animated.Value`, hook it up to one or more style attributes of an animated component, and then drive updates via animations using `Animated.timing()`.

> Don't modify the animated value directly. You can use the `useRef` Hook to return a mutable ref object. This ref object's `current` property is initialized as the given argument and persists throughout the component lifecycle.

### Example

The following example contains a `View` which will fade in and fade out based on the animated value `fadeAnim`

Refer to the Animations guide to see additional examples of `Animated` in action.

### Overview

There are two value types you can use with `Animated`:

- `Animated.Value()` for single values
- `Animated.ValueXY()` for vectors

`Animated.Value` can bind to style properties or other props, and can be interpolated as well. A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties.

#### Configuring animations

`Animated` provides three types of animation types. Each animation type provides a particular animation curve that controls how your values animate from their initial value to the final value:

- `Animated.decay()` starts with an initial velocity and gradually slows to a stop.
- `Animated.spring()` provides a basic spring physics model.
- `Animated.timing()` animates a value over time using easing functions.

In most cases, you will be using `timing()`. By default, it uses a symmetric easeInOut curve that conveys the gradual acceleration of an object to full speed and concludes by gradually decelerating to a stop.

#### Working with animations

Animations are started by calling `start()` on your animation. `start()` takes a completion callback that will be called when the animation is done. If the animation finished running normally, the completion callback will be invoked with `{finished: true}`. If the animation is done because `stop()` was called on it before it could finish (e.g. because it was interrupted by a gesture or another animation), then it will receive `{finished: false}`.

```
Animated.timing({}).start(({finished}) => {
  /* completion callback */
});
```

#### Using the native driver

By using the native driver, we send everything about the animation to native before starting the animation, allowing native code to perform the animation on the UI thread without having to go through the bridge on every frame. Once the animation has started, the JS thread can be blocked without affecting the animation.

You can use the native driver by specifying `useNativeDriver: true` in your animation configuration. See the Animations guide to learn more.

#### Animatable components

Only animatable components can be animated. These unique components do the magic of binding the animated values to the properties, and do targeted native updates to avoid the cost of the React render and reconciliation process on every frame. They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.

- `createAnimatedComponent()` can be used to make a component animatable.

`Animated` exports the following animatable components using the above wrapper:

- `Animated.Image`
- `Animated.ScrollView`
- `Animated.Text`
- `Animated.View`
- `Animated.FlatList`
- `Animated.SectionList`

#### Composing animations

Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions:

- `Animated.delay()` starts an animation after a given delay.
- `Animated.parallel()` starts a number of animations at the same time.
- `Animated.sequence()` starts the animations in order, waiting for each to complete before starting the next.
- `Animated.stagger()` starts animations in order and in parallel, but with successive delays.

Animations can also be chained together by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`. See Tracking dynamic values in the Animations guide.

By default, if one animation is stopped or interrupted, then all other animations in the group are also stopped.

#### Combining animated values

You can combine two animated values via addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or modulo to make a new animated value:

-
-
-
-
-

#### Interpolation

The `interpolate()` function allows input ranges to map to different output ranges. By default, it will extrapolate the curve beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value. It uses linear interpolation by default but also supports easing functions.

-

Read more about interpolation in the Animation guide.

#### Handling gestures and other events

Gestures, like panning or scrolling, and other events can map directly to animated values using `Animated.event()`. This is done with a structured map syntax so that values can be extracted from complex event objects. The first level is an array to allow mapping across multiple args, and that array contains nested objects.

-

For example, when working with horizontal scrolling gestures, you would do the following in order to map `event.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x` to `scrollX` (an `Animated.Value`):

```
 onScroll={Animated.event(
   // scrollX = e.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x
   [{nativeEvent: {
        contentOffset: {
          x: scrollX
        }
      }
    }]
 )}
```

### Reference

### Methods

When the given value is a ValueXY instead of a Value, each config option may be a vector of the form `{x: ..., y: ...}` instead of a scalar.

#### `decay()`

```
static decay(value, config): CompositeAnimation;
```

Animates a value from an initial velocity to zero based on a decay coefficient.

Config is an object that may have the following options:

- `velocity`: Initial velocity. Required.
- `deceleration`: Rate of decay. Default 0.997.
- `isInteraction`: Whether or not this animation creates an "interaction handle" on the `InteractionManager`. Default true.
- `useNativeDriver`: Uses the native driver when true. Required.

---

#### `timing()`

```
static timing(value, config): CompositeAnimation;
```

Animates a value along a timed easing curve. The `Easing` module has tons of predefined curves, or you can use your own function.

Config is an object that may have the following options:

- `duration`: Length of animation (milliseconds). Default 500.
- `easing`: Easing function to define curve. Default is `Easing.inOut(Easing.ease)`.
- `delay`: Start the animation after delay (milliseconds). Default 0.
- `isInteraction`: Whether or not this animation creates an "interaction handle" on the `InteractionManager`. Default true.
- `useNativeDriver`: Uses the native driver when true. Required.

---

#### `spring()`

```
static spring(value, config): CompositeAnimation;
```

Animates a value according to an analytical spring model based on damped harmonic oscillation. Tracks velocity state to create fluid motions as the `toValue` updates, and can be chained together.

Config is an object that may have the following options.

Note that you can only define one of bounciness/speed, tension/friction, or stiffness/damping/mass, but not more than one:

The friction/tension or bounciness/speed options match the spring model in `Facebook Pop`, Rebound, and Origami.

- `friction`: Controls "bounciness"/overshoot. Default 7.
- `tension`: Controls speed. Default 40.
- `speed`: Controls speed of the animation. Default 12.
- `bounciness`: Controls bounciness. Default 8.

Specifying stiffness/damping/mass as parameters makes `Animated.spring` use an analytical spring model based on the motion equations of a damped harmonic oscillator. This behavior is slightly more precise and faithful to the physics behind spring dynamics, and closely mimics the implementation in iOS's CASpringAnimation.

- `stiffness`: The spring stiffness coefficient. Default 100.
- `damping`: Defines how the spring’s motion should be damped due to the forces of friction. Default 10.
- `mass`: The mass of the object attached to the end of the spring. Default 1.

Other configuration options are as follows:

- `velocity`: The initial velocity of the object attached to the spring. Default 0 (object is at rest).
- `overshootClamping`: Boolean indicating whether the spring should be clamped and not bounce. Default false.
- `restDisplacementThreshold`: The threshold of displacement from rest below which the spring should be considered at rest. Default 0.001.
- `restSpeedThreshold`: The speed at which the spring should be considered at rest in pixels per second. Default 0.001.
- `delay`: Start the animation after delay (milliseconds). Default 0.
- `isInteraction`: Whether or not this animation creates an "interaction handle" on the `InteractionManager`. Default true.
- `useNativeDriver`: Uses the native driver when true. Required.

---

#### `add()`

```
static add(a: Animated, b: Animated): AnimatedAddition;
```

Creates a new Animated value composed from two Animated values added together.

---

#### `subtract()`

```
static subtract(a: Animated, b: Animated): AnimatedSubtraction;
```

Creates a new Animated value composed by subtracting the second Animated value from the first Animated value.

---

#### `divide()`

```
static divide(a: Animated, b: Animated): AnimatedDivision;
```

Creates a new Animated value composed by dividing the first Animated value by the second Animated value.

---

#### `multiply()`

```
static multiply(a: Animated, b: Animated): AnimatedMultiplication;
```

Creates a new Animated value composed from two Animated values multiplied together.

---

#### `modulo()`

```
static modulo(a: Animated, modulus: number): AnimatedModulo;
```

Creates a new Animated value that is the (non-negative) modulo of the provided Animated value

---

#### `diffClamp()`

```
static diffClamp(a: Animated, min: number, max: number): AnimatedDiffClamp;
```

Create a new Animated value that is limited between 2 values. It uses the difference between the last value so even if the value is far from the bounds it will start changing when the value starts getting closer again. (`value = clamp(value + diff, min, max)`).

This is useful with scroll events, for example, to show the navbar when scrolling up and to hide it when scrolling down.

---

#### `delay()`

```
static delay(time: number): CompositeAnimation;
```

Starts an animation after the given delay.

---

#### `sequence()`

```
static sequence(animations: CompositeAnimation[]): CompositeAnimation;
```

Starts an array of animations in order, waiting for each to complete before starting the next. If the current running animation is stopped, no following animations will be started.

---

#### `parallel()`

```
static parallel(
  animations: CompositeAnimation[],
  config?: ParallelConfig
): CompositeAnimation;
```

Starts an array of animations all at the same time. By default, if one of the animations is stopped, they will all be stopped. You can override this with the `stopTogether` flag.

---

#### `stagger()`

```
static stagger(
  time: number,
  animations: CompositeAnimation[]
): CompositeAnimation;
```

Array of animations may run in parallel (overlap), but are started in sequence with successive delays. Nice for doing trailing effects.

---

#### `loop()`

```
static loop(
  animation: CompositeAnimation[],
  config?: LoopAnimationConfig
): CompositeAnimation;
```

Loops a given animation continuously, so that each time it reaches the end, it resets and begins again from the start. Will loop without blocking the JS thread if the child animation is set to `useNativeDriver: true`. In addition, loops can prevent `VirtualizedList`-based components from rendering more rows while the animation is running. You can pass `isInteraction: false` in the child animation config to fix this.

Config is an object that may have the following options:

- `iterations`: Number of times the animation should loop. Default `-1` (infinite).

---

#### `event()`

```
static event(
  argMapping: Mapping[],
  config?: EventConfig
): (...args: any[]) => void;
```

Takes an array of mappings and extracts values from each arg accordingly, then calls `setValue` on the mapped outputs. e.g.

```
onScroll={Animated.event(
  [{nativeEvent: {contentOffset: {x: this._scrollX}}}],
  {listener: (event: ScrollEvent) => console.log(event)}, // Optional async listener
)}
 ...
onPanResponderMove: Animated.event(
  [
    null, // raw event arg ignored
    {dx: this._panX},
  ], // gestureState arg
  {
    listener: (
      event: GestureResponderEvent,
      gestureState: PanResponderGestureState
    ) => console.log(event, gestureState),
  } // Optional async listener
);
```

Config is an object that may have the following options:

- `listener`: Optional async listener.
- `useNativeDriver`: Uses the native driver when true. Required.

---

#### `forkEvent()`

jsx

```
static forkEvent(event: AnimatedEvent, listener: Function): AnimatedEvent;
```

Advanced imperative API for snooping on animated events that are passed in through props. It permits to add a new javascript listener to an existing `AnimatedEvent`. If `animatedEvent` is a javascript listener, it will merge the 2 listeners into a single one, and if `animatedEvent` is null/undefined, it will assign the javascript listener directly. Use values directly where possible.

---

#### `unforkEvent()`

jsx

```
static unforkEvent(event: AnimatedEvent, listener: Function);
```

---

#### `start()`

```
static start(callback?: (result: {finished: boolean}) => void);
```

Animations are started by calling start() on your animation. start() takes a completion callback that will be called when the animation is done or when the animation is done because stop() was called on it before it could finish.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| callback | `(result: {finished: boolean}) => void` | No | Function that will be called after the animation finished running normally or when the animation is done because stop() was called on it before it could finish |

Start example with callback:

```
Animated.timing({}).start(({finished}) => {
  /* completion callback */
});
```

---

#### `stop()`

```
static stop();
```

Stops any running animation.

---

#### `reset()`

```
static reset();
```

Stops any running animation and resets the value to its original.

### Properties

#### `Value`

Standard value class for driving animations. Typically initialized with `useAnimatedValue(0);` or `new Animated.Value(0);` in class components.

You can read more about `Animated.Value` API on the separate page.

---

#### `ValueXY`

2D value class for driving 2D animations, such as pan gestures.

You can read more about `Animated.ValueXY` API on the separate page.

---

#### `Interpolation`

Exported to use the Interpolation type in flow.

---

#### `Node`

Exported for ease of type checking. All animated values derive from this class.

---

#### `createAnimatedComponent`

Make any React component Animatable. Used to create `Animated.View`, etc.

---

#### `attachNativeEvent`

Imperative API to attach an animated value to an event on a view. Prefer using `Animated.event` with `useNativeDriver: true` if possible.

## 1. Enable Debugging over USB

Most Android devices can only install and run apps downloaded from Google Play, by default. You will need to enable USB Debugging on your device in order to install your app during development.

To enable USB debugging on your device, you will first need to enable the "Developer options" menu by going to **Settings** → **About phone** → **Software information** and then tapping the `Build number` row at the bottom seven times. You can then go back to **Settings** → **Developer options** to enable "USB debugging".

#### 2. Plug in your device via USB

Let's now set up an Android device to run our React Native projects. Go ahead and plug in your device via USB to your development machine.

Now check that your device is properly connecting to ADB, the Android Debug Bridge, by running `adb devices`.

shell

```
$ adb devices
List of devices attached
emulator-5554 offline   # Google emulator
14ed2fcc device         # Physical device
```

Seeing `device` in the right column means the device is connected. You must have **only one device connected** at a time.

note

If you see `unauthorized` in the list you will need to run `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081` and press allow USB debugging on the device.

#### 3. Run your app

From the root of your project; type the following in your command prompt to install and launch your app on the device:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run android
```

shell

```
yarn android
```

> If you get a "bridge configuration isn't available" error, see Using adb reverse.

> Hint: You can also use the `React Native CLI` to generate and run a `release` build (e.g. from the root of your project: `yarn android --mode release`).

### Connecting to the development server

You can also iterate quickly on a device by connecting to the development server running on your development machine. There are several ways of accomplishing this, depending on whether you have access to a USB cable or a Wi-Fi network.

#### Method 1: Using adb reverse (recommended)

You can use this method if your device is running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or newer, it has USB debugging enabled, and it is connected via USB to your development machine.

Run the following in a command prompt:

shell

```
$ adb -s <device name> reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
```

To find the device name, run the following adb command:

shell

```
$ adb devices
```

You can now enable Fast Refresh from the Dev Menu. Your app will reload whenever your JavaScript code has changed.

#### Method 2: Connect via Wi-Fi

You can also connect to the development server over Wi-Fi. You'll first need to install the app on your device using a USB cable, but once that has been done you can debug wirelessly by following these instructions. You'll need your development machine's current IP address before proceeding.

You can find the IP address in **System Settings (or System Preferences)** → **Network**.

1. Make sure your laptop and your phone are on the **same** Wi-Fi network.
2. Open your React Native app on your device.
3. You'll see a red screen with an error. This is OK. The following steps will fix that.
4. Open the in-app Dev Menu.
5. Go to **Dev Settings** → **Debug server host & port for device**.
6. Type in your machine's IP address and the port of the local dev server (e.g. `10.0.1.1:8081`).
7. Go back to the **Dev Menu** and select **Reload JS**.

You can now enable Fast Refresh from the Dev Menu. Your app will reload whenever your JavaScript code has changed.

### Building your app for production

You have built a great app using React Native, and you are now itching to release it in the Play Store. The process is the same as any other native Android app, with some additional considerations to take into account. Follow the guide for generating a signed APK to learn more.

#### 2. Plug in your device via USB

Let's now set up an Android device to run our React Native projects. Go ahead and plug in your device via USB to your development machine.

Next, check the manufacturer code by using `lsusb` (on mac, you must first install lsusb). `lsusb` should output something like this:

bash

```
$ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 22b8:2e76 Motorola PCS
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

These lines represent the USB devices currently connected to your machine.

You want the line that represents your phone. If you're in doubt, try unplugging your phone and running the command again:

bash

```
$ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

You'll see that after removing the phone, the line which has the phone model ("Motorola PCS" in this case) disappeared from the list. This is the line that we care about.

`Bus 001 Device 003: ID 22b8:2e76 Motorola PCS`

From the above line, you want to grab the first four digits from the device ID:

`22b8:2e76`

In this case, it's `22b8`. That's the identifier for Motorola.

You'll need to input this into your udev rules in order to get up and running:

shell

```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="22b8", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android-usb.rules
```

Make sure that you replace `22b8` with the identifier you get in the above command.

Now check that your device is properly connecting to ADB, the Android Debug Bridge, by running `adb devices`.

shell

```
$ adb devices
List of devices attached
emulator-5554 offline   # Google emulator
14ed2fcc device         # Physical device
```

Seeing `device` in the right column means the device is connected. You must have **only one device connected** at a time.

### Building your app for production

You have built a great app using React Native, and you are now itching to release it in the Play Store. The process is the same as any other native Android app, with some additional considerations to take into account. Follow the guide for generating a signed APK to learn more.

## Fast Refresh

Fast Refresh is a React Native feature that allows you to get near-instant feedback for changes in your React components. Fast Refresh is enabled by default, and you can toggle "Enable Fast Refresh" in the React Native Dev Menu. With Fast Refresh enabled, most edits should be visible within a second or two.

### How It Works

- If you edit a module that **only exports React component(s)**, Fast Refresh will update the code only for that module, and re-render your component. You can edit anything in that file, including styles, rendering logic, event handlers, or effects.
- If you edit a module with exports that _aren't_ React components, Fast Refresh will re-run both that module, and the other modules importing it. So if both `Button.js` and `Modal.js` import `Theme.js`, editing `Theme.js` will update both components.
- Finally, if you **edit a file** that's **imported by modules outside of the React tree**, Fast Refresh **will fall back to doing a full reload**. You might have a file which renders a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a **non-React component**. For example, maybe your component also exports a constant, and a non-React utility module imports it. In that case, consider migrating the constant to a separate file and importing it into both files. This will re-enable Fast Refresh to work. Other cases can usually be solved in a similar way.

### Error Resilience

If you make a **syntax error** during a Fast Refresh session, you can fix it and save the file again. The redbox will disappear. Modules with syntax errors are prevented from running, so you won't need to reload the app.

If you make a **runtime error during the module initialization** (for example, typing `Style.create` instead of `StyleSheet.create`), the Fast Refresh session will continue once you fix the error. The redbox will disappear, and the module will be updated.

If you make a mistake that leads to a **runtime error inside your component**, the Fast Refresh session will _also_ continue after you fix the error. In that case, React will remount your application using the updated code.

If you have error boundaries in your app (which is a good idea for graceful failures in production), they will retry rendering on the next edit after a redbox. In that sense, having an error boundary can prevent you from always getting kicked out to the root app screen. However, keep in mind that error boundaries shouldn't be _too_ granular. They are used by React in production, and should always be designed intentionally.

### Limitations

Fast Refresh tries to preserve local React state in the component you're editing, but only if it's safe to do so. Here's a few reasons why you might see local state being reset on every edit to a file:

- Local state is not preserved for class components (only function components and Hooks preserve state).
- The module you're editing might have _other_ exports in addition to a React component.
- Sometimes, a module would export the result of calling higher-order component like `createNavigationContainer(MyScreen)`. If the returned component is a class, state will be reset.

In the longer term, as more of your codebase moves to function components and Hooks, you can expect state to be preserved in more cases.

### Tips

- Fast Refresh preserves React local state in function components (and Hooks) by default.
- Sometimes you might want to _force_ the state to be reset, and a component to be remounted. For example, this can be handy if you're tweaking an animation that only happens on mount. To do this, you can add `// @refresh reset` anywhere in the file you're editing. This directive is local to the file, and instructs Fast Refresh to remount components defined in that file on every edit.

### Fast Refresh and Hooks

When possible, Fast Refresh attempts to preserve the state of your component between edits. In particular, `useState` and `useRef` preserve their previous values as long as you don't change their arguments or the order of the Hook calls.

Hooks with dependencies—such as `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`—will _always_ update during Fast Refresh. Their list of dependencies will be ignored while Fast Refresh is happening.

For example, when you edit `useMemo(() => x * 2, [x])` to `useMemo(() => x * 10, [x])`, it will re-run even though `x` (the dependency) has not changed. If React didn't do that, your edit wouldn't reflect on the screen!

Sometimes, this can lead to unexpected results. For example, even a `useEffect` with an empty array of dependencies would still re-run once during Fast Refresh. However, writing code resilient to an occasional re-running of `useEffect` is a good practice even without Fast Refresh. This makes it easier for you to later introduce new dependencies to it.

## Image

A React component for displaying different types of images, including network images, static resources, temporary local images, and images from local disk, such as the camera roll.

This example shows fetching and displaying an image from local storage as well as one from network and even from data provided in the `'data:'` uri scheme.

> Note that for network and data images, you will need to manually specify the dimensions of your image!

### Examples

You can also add `style` to an image:

### GIF and WebP support on Android

When building your own native code, GIF and WebP are not supported by default on Android.

You will need to add some optional modules in `android/app/build.gradle`, depending on the needs of your app.

groovy

```
dependencies {
  // If your app supports Android versions before Ice Cream Sandwich (API level 14)
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-base-support:1.3.0'

  // For animated GIF support
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-gif:3.2.0'

  // For WebP support, including animated WebP
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-webp:3.2.0'
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:3.2.0'

  // For WebP support, without animations
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:3.2.0'
}
```

> Note: the version listed above may not be updated in time. Please check `packages/react-native/gradle/libs.versions.toml` in the main repo to see which fresco version is being used in a specific tagged version.

| ---------- |
| () => void |

---

#### `onProgress`

Invoked on download progress.

| Type                                        |

---

#### `resizeMethod`Android

The mechanism that should be used to resize the image when the image's dimensions differ from the image view's dimensions. Defaults to `auto`.

- `auto`: Use heuristics to pick between `resize` and `scale`.

- `resize`: A software operation which changes the encoded image in memory before it gets decoded. This should be used instead of `scale` when the image is much larger than the view.

- `scale`: The image gets drawn downscaled or upscaled. Compared to `resize`, `scale` is faster (usually hardware accelerated) and produces higher quality images. This should be used if the image is smaller than the view. It should also be used if the image is slightly bigger than the view.

- `none`: No sampling is performed and the image is displayed in its full resolution. This should only be used in rare circumstances because it is considered unsafe as Android will throw a runtime exception when trying to render images that consume too much memory.

More details about `resize` and `scale` can be found at <https://frescolib.org/docs/resizing>.

| Type                                            | Default  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum(`'auto'`, `'resize'`, `'scale'`, `'none'`) | `'auto'` |

---

#### `resizeMode`

Determines how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw image dimensions. Defaults to `cover`.

- `cover`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that

  - both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding)
  - at least one dimension of the scaled image will be equal to the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding)

- `contain`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).

- `stretch`: Scale width and height independently, This may change the aspect ratio of the src.

- `repeat`: Repeat the image to cover the frame of the view. The image will keep its size and aspect ratio, unless it is larger than the view, in which case it will be scaled down uniformly so that it is contained in the view.

- `center`: Center the image in the view along both dimensions. If the image is larger than the view, scale it down uniformly so that it is contained in the view.

| Type | Default |
| --- | --- |
| enum(`'cover'`, `'contain'`, `'stretch'`, `'repeat'`, `'center'`) | `'cover'` |

---

#### `resizeMultiplier`Android

When the `resizeMethod` is set to `resize`, the destination dimensions are multiplied by this value. The `scale` method is used to perform the remainder of the resize. A default of `1.0` means the bitmap size is designed to fit the destination dimensions. A multiplier greater than `1.0` will set the resize options larger than that of the destination dimensions, and the resulting bitmap will be scaled down from the hardware size. Defaults to `1.0`.

This prop is most useful in cases where the destination dimensions are quite small and the source image is significantly larger. The `resize` resize method performs downsampling and significant image quality is lost between the source and destination image sizes, often resulting in a blurry image. By using a multiplier, the decoded image is slightly larger than the target size but smaller than the source image (if the source image is large enough). This allows aliasing artifacts to produce faux quality through scaling operations on the multiplied image.

If you have a source image with dimensions 200x200 and destination dimensions of 24x24, a resizeMultiplier of `2.0` will tell Fresco to downsample the image to 48x48. Fresco picks the closest power of 2 (so, 50x50) and decodes the image into a bitmap of that size. Without the multiplier, the closest power of 2 would be 25x25. The resultant image is scaled down by the system.

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| number | `1.0`   |

---

#### `source`

The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).

This prop can also contain several remote URLs, specified together with their width and height and potentially with scale/other URI arguments. The native side will then choose the best `uri` to display based on the measured size of the image container. A `cache` property can be added to control how networked request interacts with the local cache. (For more information see Cache Control for Images).

The currently supported formats are `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `bmp`, `gif`, `webp`, `psd` (iOS only). In addition, iOS supports several RAW image formats. Refer to Apple's documentation for the current list of supported camera models (for iOS 12, see <https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208967>).

Please note that the `webp` format is supported on iOS **only** when bundled with the JavaScript code.

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `src`

A string representing the remote URL of the image. This prop has precedence over `source` prop.

**Example:** `src={'https://reactnative.dev/img/tiny_logo.png'}`

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

#### `srcSet`

A string representing comma separated list of possible candidate image source. Each image source contains a URL of an image and a pixel density descriptor. If no descriptor is specified, it defaults to descriptor of `1x`.

If `srcSet` does not contain a `1x` descriptor, the value in `src` is used as image source with `1x` descriptor (if provided).

This prop has precedence over both the `src` and `source` props.

**Example:** `srcSet={'https://reactnative.dev/img/tiny_logo.png 1x, https://reactnative.dev/img/header_logo.svg 2x'}`

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

#### `style`

| Type                                                      |

### Methods

#### `abortPrefetch()`Android

```
static abortPrefetch(requestId: number);
```

Abort prefetch request.

**Parameters:**

| Name              | Type   | Description                             |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| requestIdRequired | number | Request id as returned by `prefetch()`. |

---

#### `getSize()`

```
static getSize(uri: string): Promise<{width: number, height: number}>;
```

Retrieve the width and height (in pixels) of an image prior to displaying it. This method can fail if the image cannot be found, or fails to download.

In order to retrieve the image dimensions, the image may first need to be loaded or downloaded, after which it will be cached. This means that in principle you could use this method to preload images, however it is not optimized for that purpose, and may in future be implemented in a way that does not fully load/download the image data. A proper, supported way to preload images will be provided as a separate API.

**Parameters:**

| Name        | Type   | Description                |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| uriRequired | string | The location of the image. |

---

#### `getSizeWithHeaders()`

```
static getSizeWithHeaders(
  uri: string,
  headers: {[index: string]: string}
): Promise<{width: number, height: number}>;
```

Retrieve the width and height (in pixels) of an image prior to displaying it with the ability to provide the headers for the request. This method can fail if the image cannot be found, or fails to download. It also does not work for static image resources.

In order to retrieve the image dimensions, the image may first need to be loaded or downloaded, after which it will be cached. This means that in principle you could use this method to preload images, however it is not optimized for that purpose, and may in future be implemented in a way that does not fully load/download the image data. A proper, supported way to preload images will be provided as a separate API.

**Parameters:**

| Name            | Type   | Description                  |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| uriRequired     | string | The location of the image.   |
| headersRequired | object | The headers for the request. |

---

#### `prefetch()`

```
await Image.prefetch(url);
```

Prefetches a remote image for later use by downloading it to the disk cache. Returns a promise which resolves to a boolean.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| urlRequired | string | The remote location of the image. |
| callback | functionAndroid | The function that will be called with the `requestId`. |

---

#### `queryCache()`

```
static queryCache(
  urls: string[],
): Promise<Record<string, 'memory' | 'disk' | 'disk/memory'>>;
```

Perform cache interrogation. Returns a promise which resolves to a mapping from URL to cache status, such as "disk", "memory" or "disk/memory". If a requested URL is not in the mapping, it means it's not in the cache.

**Parameters:**

| Name         | Type  | Description                                |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| urlsRequired | array | List of image URLs to check the cache for. |

---

#### `resolveAssetSource()`

```
static resolveAssetSource(source: ImageSourcePropType): {
  height: number;
  width: number;
  scale: number;
  uri: string;
};
```

Resolves an asset reference into an object which has the properties `uri`, `scale`, `width`, and `height`.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sourceRequired | ImageSource, number | A number (opaque type returned by `require('./foo.png')`) or an ImageSource. |

### Type Definitions

#### ImageCacheEnumiOS

Enum which can be used to set the cache handling or strategy for the potentially cached responses.

| Type | Default |
| --- | --- |
| enum(`'default'`, `'reload'`, `'force-cache'`, `'only-if-cached'`) | `'default'` |

- `default`: Use the native platforms default strategy.
- `reload`: The data for the URL will be loaded from the originating source. No existing cache data should be used to satisfy a URL load request.
- `force-cache`: The existing cached data will be used to satisfy the request, regardless of its age or expiration date. If there is no existing data in the cache corresponding the request, the data is loaded from the originating source.
- `only-if-cached`: The existing cache data will be used to satisfy a request, regardless of its age or expiration date. If there is no existing data in the cache corresponding to a URL load request, no attempt is made to load the data from the originating source, and the load is considered to have failed.

#### ImageLoadEvent

Object returned in the `onLoad` callback.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| object |

**Properties:**

| Name   | Type   | Description       |
| ------ | ------ | ----------------- |

## Metro

React Native uses Metro to build your JavaScript code and assets.

### Configuring Metro

Configuration options for Metro can be customized in your project's `metro.config.js` file. This can export either:

- **An object (recommended)** that will be merged on top of Metro's internal config defaults.
- **A function** that will be called with Metro's internal config defaults and should return a final config object.

tip

Please see **Configuring Metro** on the Metro website for documentation on all available config options.

In React Native, your Metro config should extend either `@react-native/metro-config` or `@expo/metro-config`. These packages contain essential defaults necessary to build and run React Native apps.

Below is the default `metro.config.js` file in a React Native template project:

js

```
const {getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig} = require('@react-native/metro-config');

/**
 * Metro configuration
 * https://metrobundler.dev/docs/configuration
 *
 * @type {import('metro-config').MetroConfig}
 */
const config = {};

module.exports = mergeConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), config);
```

Metro options you wish to customize can be done so within the `config` object.

#### Advanced: Using a config function

Exporting a config function is an opt-in to managing the final config yourself — **Metro will not apply any internal defaults**. This pattern can be useful when needing to read the base default config object from Metro or to set options dynamically.

info

**From `@react-native/metro-config` 0.72.1**, it is no longer necessary to use a config function to access the complete default config. See the **Tip** section below.

js

```
const {getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig} = require('@react-native/metro-config');

module.exports = function (baseConfig) {
  const defaultConfig = mergeConfig(baseConfig, getDefaultConfig(__dirname));
  const {resolver: {assetExts, sourceExts}} = defaultConfig;

  return mergeConfig(
    defaultConfig,
    {
      resolver: {
        assetExts: assetExts.filter(ext => ext !== 'svg'),
        sourceExts: [...sourceExts, 'svg'],
      },
    },
  );
};
```

tip

Using a config function is for advanced use cases. A simpler method than the above, e.g. for customising `sourceExts`, would be to read these defaults from `@react-native/metro-config`.

**Alternative**

js

```
const defaultConfig = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

const config = {
  resolver: {
    sourceExts: [...defaultConfig.resolver.sourceExts, 'svg'],
  },
};

module.exports = mergeConfig(defaultConfig, config);
```

**However!**, we recommend copying and editing when overriding these config values — placing the source of truth in your config file.

✅ **Recommended**

js

```
const config = {
  resolver: {
    sourceExts: ['js', 'ts', 'tsx', 'svg'],
  },
};
```

## ImageBackground

A common feature request from developers familiar with the web is `background-image`. To handle this use case, you can use the `<ImageBackground>` component, which has the same props as `<Image>`, and add whatever children to it you would like to layer on top of it.

You might not want to use `<ImageBackground>` in some cases, since the implementation is basic. Refer to `<ImageBackground>`'s source code for more insight, and create your own custom component when needed.

Note that you must specify some width and height style attributes.

## Using Libraries

React Native provides a set of built-in Core Components and APIs ready to use in your app. You're not limited to the components and APIs bundled with React Native. React Native has a community of thousands of developers. If the Core Components and APIs don't have what you are looking for, you may be able to find and install a library from the community to add the functionality to your app.

### Selecting a Package Manager

React Native libraries are typically installed from the npm registry using a Node.js package manager such as npm CLI or Yarn Classic.

If you have Node.js installed on your computer then you already have the npm CLI installed. Some developers prefer to use Yarn Classic for slightly faster install times and additional advanced features like Workspaces. Both tools work great with React Native. We will assume npm for the rest of this guide for simplicity of explanation.

> 💡 The terms "library" and "package" are used interchangeably in the JavaScript community.

### Installing a Library

To install a library in your project, navigate to your project directory in your terminal and run the installation command. Let's try this with `react-native-webview`:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm install react-native-webview
```

shell

```
yarn add react-native-webview
```

The library that we installed includes native code, and we need to link to our app before we use it.

### Linking Native Code on iOS

React Native uses CocoaPods to manage iOS project dependencies and most React Native libraries follow this same convention. If a library you are using does not, then please refer to their README for additional instruction. In most cases, the following instructions will apply.

Run `pod install` in our `ios` directory in order to link it to our native iOS project. A shortcut for doing this without switching to the `ios` directory is to run `npx pod-install`.

bash

```
npx pod-install
```

Once this is complete, re-build the app binary to start using your new library:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run ios
```

shell

```
yarn ios
```

### Linking Native Code on Android

React Native uses Gradle to manage Android project dependencies. After you install a library with native dependencies, you will need to re-build the app binary to use your new library:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run android
```

shell

```
yarn android
```

### Finding Libraries

React Native Directory is a searchable database of libraries built specifically for React Native. This is the first place to look for a library for your React Native app.

Many of the libraries you will find on the directory are from React Native Community or Expo.

Libraries built by the React Native Community are driven by volunteers and individuals at companies that depend on React Native. They often support iOS, tvOS, Android, Windows, but this varies across projects. Many of the libraries in this organization were once React Native Core Components and APIs.

Libraries built by Expo are all written in TypeScript and support iOS, Android, and `react-native-web` wherever possible.

After React Native Directory, the npm registry is the next best place if you can't find a library specifically for React Native on the directory. The npm registry is the definitive source for JavaScript libraries, but the libraries that it lists may not all be compatible with React Native. React Native is one of many JavaScript programming environments, including Node.js, web browsers, Electron, and more, and npm includes libraries that work for all of these environments.

### Determining Library Compatibility

#### Does it work with React Native?

Usually libraries built _specifically for other platforms_ will not work with React Native. Examples include `react-select` which is built for the web and specifically targets `react-dom`, and `rimraf` which is built for Node.js and interacts with your computer file system. Other libraries like `lodash` use only JavaScript language features and work in any environment. You will gain a sense for this over time, but until then the easiest way to find out is to try it yourself. You can remove packages using `npm uninstall` if it turns out that it does not work in React Native.

#### Does it work for the platforms that my app supports?

React Native Directory allows you to filter by platform compatibility, such as iOS, Android, Web, and Windows. If the library you would like to use is not currently listed there, refer to the README for the library to learn more.

#### Does it work with my app version of React Native?

The latest version of a library is typically compatible with the latest version of React Native. If you are using an older version, you should refer to the README to know which version of the library you should install. You can install a particular version of the library by running `npm install <library-name>@<version-number>`, for example: `npm install @react-native-community/netinfo@^2.0.0`.

| enum(`'none'`, `'slide'`, `'fade'`) | `none`  |

---

#### `backdropColor`

The `backdropColor` of the modal (or background color of the modal's container.) Defaults to `white` if not provided and transparent is `false`. Ignored if `transparent` is `true`.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
|      | white   |

---

#### `hardwareAccelerated`Android

| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

#### `navigationBarTranslucent`Android

The `navigationBarTranslucent` prop determines whether your modal should go under the system navigation bar. However, `statusBarTranslucent` also needs to be set to `true` to make navigation bar translucent.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

#### `onDismiss`iOS

The `onDismiss` prop allows passing a function that will be called once the modal has been dismissed.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `onOrientationChange`iOS

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `onRequestClose`

The `onRequestClose` callback is called when the user taps the hardware back button on Android or the menu button on Apple TV. Because of this required prop, be aware that `BackHandler` events will not be emitted as long as the modal is open. On iOS, this callback is called when a Modal is being dismissed using a drag gesture when `presentationStyle` is `pageSheet or formSheet`

## Upgrading to new versions

Upgrading to new versions of React Native will give you access to more APIs, views, developer tools and other goodies. Upgrading requires a small amount of effort, but we try to make it straightforward for you.

### Expo projects

Upgrading your Expo project to a new version of React Native requires updating the `react-native`, `react`, and `expo` package versions in your `package.json` file. Expo recommends upgrading SDK versions incrementally, one at a time. Doing so will help you pinpoint breakages and issues that arise during the upgrade process. See the Upgrading Expo SDK Walkthrough for up-to-date information about upgrading your project.

### React Native projects

Because typical React Native projects are essentially made up of an Android project, an iOS project, and a JavaScript project, upgrading can be rather tricky. The Upgrade Helper is a web tool to help you out when upgrading your apps by providing the full set of changes happening between any two versions. It also shows comments on specific files to help understanding why that change is needed.

#### 1. Select the versions

You first need to select from and to which version you wish to upgrade, by default the latest major versions are selected. After selecting you can click the button "Show me how to upgrade".

💡 Major updates will show a "useful content" section on the top with links to help you out when upgrading.

#### 2. Upgrade dependencies

The first file that is shown is the `package.json`, it's good to update the dependencies that are showing in there. For example, if `react-native` and `react` appears as changes then you can install it in your project by running following commands:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
# {{VERSION}} and {{REACT_VERSION}} are the release versions showing in the diff
npm install react-native@{{VERSION}}
npm install react@{{REACT_VERSION}}
```

shell

```
# {{VERSION}} and {{REACT_VERSION}} are the release versions showing in the diff
yarn add react-native@{{VERSION}}
yarn add react@{{REACT_VERSION}}
```

#### 3. Upgrade your project files

The new release may contain updates to other files that are generated when you run `npx react-native init`, those files are listed after the `package.json` in the Upgrade Helper page. If there aren't other changes then you only need to rebuild the project to continue developing. In case there are changes you need to manually apply them into your project.

#### Troubleshooting

##### I have done all the changes but my app is still using an old version

These sort of errors are usually related to caching, it's recommended to install react-native-clean-project to clear all your project's cache and then you can run it again.

## Pressable

Pressable is a Core Component wrapper that can detect various stages of press interactions on any of its defined children.

```
<Pressable onPress={onPressFunction}>
  <Text>I'm pressable!</Text>
</Pressable>
```

### How it works

On an element wrapped by `Pressable`:

- `onPressIn` is called when a press is activated.
- `onPressOut` is called when the press gesture is deactivated.

After pressing `onPressIn`, one of two things will happen:

1. The person will remove their finger, triggering `onPressOut` followed by `onPress`.
2. If the person leaves their finger longer than 500 milliseconds before removing it, `onLongPress` is triggered. (`onPressOut` will still fire when they remove their finger.)

Fingers are not the most precise instruments, and it is common for users to accidentally activate the wrong element or miss the activation area. To help, `Pressable` has an optional `HitRect` you can use to define how far a touch can register away from the wrapped element. Presses can start anywhere within a `HitRect`.

`PressRect` allows presses to move beyond the element and its `HitRect` while maintaining activation and being eligible for a "press"—think of sliding your finger slowly away from a button you're pressing down on.

> The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views.

You can set `HitRect` with `hitSlop` and set `PressRect` with `pressRetentionOffset`.

> `Pressable` uses React Native's `Pressability` API. For more information around the state machine flow of Pressability and how it works, check out the implementation for Pressability.

## Style

With React Native, you style your application using JavaScript. All of the core components accept a prop named `style`. The style names and values usually match how CSS works on the web, except names are written using camel casing, e.g. `backgroundColor` rather than `background-color`.

The `style` prop can be a plain old JavaScript object. That's what we usually use for example code. You can also pass an array of styles - the last style in the array has precedence, so you can use this to inherit styles.

As a component grows in complexity, it is often cleaner to use `StyleSheet.create` to define several styles in one place. Here's an example:

One common pattern is to make your component accept a `style` prop which in turn is used to style subcomponents. You can use this to make styles "cascade" the way they do in CSS.

There are a lot more ways to customize the text style. Check out the Text component reference for a complete list.

Now you can make your text beautiful. The next step in becoming a style expert is to learn how to control component size.

### Known issues

- react-native#29308: In some cases React Native does not match how CSS works on the web, for example the touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and on Android negative margin is not supported.

## ScrollView

Component that wraps platform ScrollView while providing integration with touch locking "responder" system.

Keep in mind that ScrollViews must have a bounded height in order to work, since they contain unbounded-height children into a bounded container (via a scroll interaction). In order to bound the height of a ScrollView, either set the height of the view directly (discouraged) or make sure all parent views have bounded height. Forgetting to transfer `{flex: 1}` down the view stack can lead to errors here, which the element inspector makes quick to debug.

Doesn't yet support other contained responders from blocking this scroll view from becoming the responder.

`<ScrollView>` vs `<FlatList>` - which one to use?

`ScrollView` renders all its react child components at once, but this has a performance downside.

Imagine you have a very long list of items you want to display, maybe several screens worth of content. Creating JS components and native views for everything all at once, much of which may not even be shown, will contribute to slow rendering and increased memory usage.

This is where `FlatList` comes into play. `FlatList` renders items lazily, when they are about to appear, and removes items that scroll way off screen to save memory and processing time.

`FlatList` is also handy if you want to render separators between your items, multiple columns, infinite scroll loading, or any number of other features it supports out of the box.

### Example

---

### Reference

### Props

#### View Props

Inherits View Props.

---

#### `StickyHeaderComponent`

A React Component that will be used to render sticky headers, should be used together with `stickyHeaderIndices`. You may need to set this component if your sticky header uses custom transforms, for example, when you want your list to have an animated and hidable header. If a component has not been provided, the default `ScrollViewStickyHeader` component will be used.

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `alwaysBounceHorizontal`iOS

When true, the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself.

| bool | `true`  |

---

#### `bounces`iOS

When true, the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the content if the content is larger than the scroll view along the axis of the scroll direction. When `false`, it disables all bouncing even if the `alwaysBounce*` props are `true`.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `true`  |

---

#### `bouncesZoom`iOS

When `true`, gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate to the min/max value at gesture end, otherwise the zoom will not exceed the limits.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `true`  |

---

#### `canCancelContentTouches`iOS

When `false`, once tracking starts, won't try to drag if the touch moves.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `true`  |

---

#### `centerContent`iOS

When `true`, the scroll view automatically centers the content when the content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is larger than the scroll view, this property has no effect.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

#### `contentContainerStyle`

These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which wraps all of the child views. Example:

```
return (
  <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>
  </ScrollView>
);
...
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  contentContainer: {
    paddingVertical: 20
  }
});
```

- `'normal'` 0.998 on iOS, 0.985 on Android.
- `'fast'`, 0.99 on iOS, 0.9 on Android.

| Type                               | Default    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| enum(`'fast'`, `'normal'`), number | `'normal'` |

---

#### `directionalLockEnabled`iOS

When true, the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal scrolling while dragging.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

#### `disableIntervalMomentum`

When true, the scroll view stops on the next index (in relation to scroll position at release) regardless of how fast the gesture is. This can be used for pagination when the page is less than the width of the horizontal ScrollView or the height of the vertical ScrollView.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

#### `disableScrollViewPanResponder`

When true, the default JS pan responder on the ScrollView is disabled, and full control over touches inside the ScrollView is left to its child components. This is particularly useful if `snapToInterval` is enabled, since it does not follow typical touch patterns. Do not use this on regular ScrollView use cases without `snapToInterval` as it may cause unexpected touches to occur while scrolling.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

#### `endFillColor`Android

Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills. When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not needed in the general case.

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `fadingEdgeLength`Android

Fades out the edges of the scroll content.

If the value is greater than `0`, the fading edges will be set accordingly to the current scroll direction and position, indicating if there is more content to show.

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| number | `0`     |

---

#### `horizontal`

When `true`, the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row instead of vertically in a column.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

#### `indicatorStyle`iOS

The style of the scroll indicators.

- `'default'` same as `black`.
- `'black'`, scroll indicator is `black`. This style is good against a light background.
- `'white'`, scroll indicator is `white`. This style is good against a dark background.

| Type                                    | Default     |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| enum(`'default'`, `'black'`, `'white'`) | `'default'` |

---

#### `invertStickyHeaders`

If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

#### `keyboardDismissMode`

Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.

- `'none'`, drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
- `'on-drag'`, the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.

**iOS Only**

- `'interactive'`, the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag and moves in synchrony with the touch, dragging upwards cancels the dismissal. On Android this is not supported and it will have the same behavior as `'none'`.

| Type | Default |
| --- | --- |
| enum(`'none'`, `'on-drag'`)Android\*\*\*enum(`'none'`, `'on-drag'`, `'interactive'`)iOS | `'none'` |

---

#### `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`

Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.

- `'never'` tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.
- `'always'`, the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.
- `'handled'`, the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by children of the scroll view (or captured by an ancestor).
- `false`, **_deprecated_**, use `'never'` instead
- `true`, **_deprecated_**, use `'always'` instead

| Type                                                      | Default   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| enum(`'always'`, `'never'`, `'handled'`, `false`, `true`) | `'never'` |

---

#### `maintainVisibleContentPosition`

When set, the scroll view will adjust the scroll position so that the first child that is currently visible and at or beyond `minIndexForVisible` will not change position. This is useful for lists that are loading content in both directions, e.g. a chat thread, where new messages coming in might otherwise cause the scroll position to jump. A value of 0 is common, but other values such as 1 can be used to skip loading spinners or other content that should not maintain position.

The optional `autoscrollToTopThreshold` can be used to make the content automatically scroll to the top after making the adjustment if the user was within the threshold of the top before the adjustment was made. This is also useful for chat-like applications where you want to see new messages scroll into place, but not if the user has scrolled up a ways and it would be disruptive to scroll a bunch.

Caveat 1: Reordering elements in the scrollview with this enabled will probably cause jumpiness and jank. It can be fixed, but there are currently no plans to do so. For now, don't re-order the content of any ScrollViews or Lists that use this feature.

Caveat 2: This uses `contentOffset` and `frame.origin` in native code to compute visibility. Occlusion, transforms, and other complexity won't be taken into account as to whether content is "visible" or not.

| Type                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `onMomentumScrollBegin`

Called when the momentum scroll starts (scroll which occurs as the ScrollView starts gliding).

When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the snapping to the scroll view.

Possible values:

- `'start'` will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical).
- `'center'` will align the snap in the center.
- `'end'` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical).

| Type                                 | Default   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| enum(`'start'`, `'center'`, `'end'`) | `'start'` |

---

#### `snapToEnd`

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `true`  |

---

#### `snapToInterval`

When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`. This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view. Typically used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `snapToOffsets`

When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view. Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less configurable `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.

| Type            |
| --------------- |
| array of number |

---

#### `snapToStart`

Use in conjunction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to `false` to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `true`  |

---

#### `stickyHeaderHiddenOnScroll`

When set to `true`, sticky header will be hidden when scrolling down the list, and it will dock at the top of the list when scrolling up.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

#### `stickyHeaderIndices`

An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the top of the screen when scrolling. For example, passing `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the top of the scroll view. You can also use like \[x,y,z] to make multiple items sticky when they are at the top. This property is not supported in conjunction with `horizontal={true}`.

| Type            |
| --------------- |
| array of number |

---

#### `zoomScale`iOS

---

### Methods

#### `flashScrollIndicators()`

```
flashScrollIndicators();
```

Displays the scroll indicators momentarily.

---

#### `scrollTo()`

```
scrollTo(
  options?: {x?: number, y?: number, animated?: boolean} | number,
  deprecatedX?: number,
  deprecatedAnimated?: boolean,
);
```

Scrolls to a given x, y offset, either immediately, with a smooth animation.

**Example:**

`scrollTo({x: 0, y: 0, animated: true})`

> Note: The weird function signature is due to the fact that, for historical reasons, the function also accepts separate arguments as an alternative to the options object. This is deprecated due to ambiguity (y before x), and SHOULD NOT BE USED.

---

#### `scrollToEnd()`

```
scrollToEnd(options?: {animated?: boolean});
```

If this is a vertical ScrollView scrolls to the bottom. If this is a horizontal ScrollView scrolls to the right.

Use `scrollToEnd({animated: true})` for smooth animated scrolling, `scrollToEnd({animated: false})` for immediate scrolling. If no options are passed, `animated` defaults to `true`.

## Height and Width

A component's height and width determine its size on the screen.

### Fixed Dimensions

The general way to set the dimensions of a component is by adding a fixed `width` and `height` to style. All dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels.

Setting dimensions this way is common for components whose size should always be fixed to a number of points and not calculated based on screen size.

caution

There is no universal mapping from points to physical units of measurement. This means that a component with fixed dimensions might not have the same physical size, across different devices and screen sizes. However, this difference is unnoticeable for most use cases.

### Flex Dimensions

Use `flex` in a component's style to have the component expand and shrink dynamically based on available space. Normally you will use `flex: 1`, which tells a component to fill all available space, shared evenly amongst other components with the same parent. The larger the `flex` given, the higher the ratio of space a component will take compared to its siblings.

info

A component can only expand to fill available space if its parent has dimensions greater than `0`. If a parent does not have either a fixed `width` and `height` or `flex`, the parent will have dimensions of `0` and the `flex` children will not be visible.

After you can control a component's size, the next step is to learn how to lay it out on the screen.

### Percentage Dimensions

If you want to fill a certain portion of the screen, but you _don't_ want to use the `flex` layout, you _can_ use **percentage values** in the component's style. Similar to flex dimensions, percentage dimensions require parent with a defined size.

## Layout with Flexbox

A component can specify the layout of its children using the Flexbox algorithm. Flexbox is designed to provide a consistent layout on different screen sizes.

You will normally use a combination of `flexDirection`, `alignItems`, and `justifyContent` to achieve the right layout.

caution

Flexbox works the same way in React Native as it does in CSS on the web, with a few exceptions. The defaults are different, with `flexDirection` defaulting to `column` instead of `row`, `alignContent` defaulting to `flex-start` instead of `stretch`, `flexShrink` defaulting to `0` instead of `1`, the `flex` parameter only supporting a single number.

### Flex

`flex` will define how your items are going to **“fill”** over the available space along your main axis. Space will be divided according to each element's flex property.

In the following example, the red, orange, and green views are all children in the container view that has `flex: 1` set. The red view uses `flex: 1` , the orange view uses `flex: 2`, and the green view uses `flex: 3` . **1+2+3 = 6**, which means that the red view will get `1/6` of the space, the orange `2/6` of the space, and the green `3/6` of the space.

### Flex Direction

`flexDirection` controls the direction in which the children of a node are laid out. This is also referred to as the main axis. The cross axis is the axis perpendicular to the main axis, or the axis which the wrapping lines are laid out in.

- `column` (**default value**) Align children from top to bottom. If wrapping is enabled, then the next line will start to the right of the first item on the top of the container.

- `row` Align children from left to right. If wrapping is enabled, then the next line will start under the first item on the left of the container.

- `column-reverse` Align children from bottom to top. If wrapping is enabled, then the next line will start to the right of the first item on the bottom of the container.

- `row-reverse` Align children from right to left. If wrapping is enabled, then the next line will start under the first item on the right of the container.

- JavaScript

### Layout Direction

Layout `direction` specifies the direction in which children and text in a hierarchy should be laid out. Layout direction also affects what edge `start` and `end` refer to. By default, React Native lays out with LTR layout direction. In this mode `start` refers to left and `end` refers to right.

- `LTR` (**default value**) Text and children are laid out from left to right. Margin and padding applied to the start of an element are applied on the left side.

- `RTL` Text and children are laid out from right to left. Margin and padding applied to the start of an element are applied on the right side.

* TypeScript
* JavaScript

### Justify Content

`justifyContent` describes how to align children within the main axis of their container. For example, you can use this property to center a child horizontally within a container with `flexDirection` set to `row` or vertically within a container with `flexDirection` set to `column`.

- `flex-start`(**default value**) Align children of a container to the start of the container's main axis.

- `flex-end` Align children of a container to the end of the container's main axis.

- `center` Align children of a container in the center of the container's main axis.

- `space-between` Evenly space off children across the container's main axis, distributing the remaining space between the children.

- `space-around` Evenly space off children across the container's main axis, distributing the remaining space around the children. Compared to `space-between`, using `space-around` will result in space being distributed to the beginning of the first child and end of the last child.

- `space-evenly` Evenly distribute children within the alignment container along the main axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent items, the main-start edge and the first item, and the main-end edge and the last item, are all exactly the same.

You can learn more here.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

### Align Items

`alignItems` describes how to align children along the cross axis of their container. It is very similar to `justifyContent` but instead of applying to the main axis, `alignItems` applies to the cross axis.

- `stretch` (**default value**) Stretch children of a container to match the `height` of the container's cross axis.

- `flex-start` Align children of a container to the start of the container's cross axis.

- `flex-end` Align children of a container to the end of the container's cross axis.

- `center` Align children of a container in the center of the container's cross axis.

- `baseline` Align children of a container along a common baseline. Individual children can be set to be the reference baseline for their parents.

info

For `stretch` to have an effect, children must not have a fixed dimension along the secondary axis. In the following example, setting `alignItems: stretch` does nothing until the `width: 50` is removed from the children.

You can learn more here.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

### Align Self

`alignSelf` has the same options and effect as `alignItems` but instead of affecting the children within a container, you can apply this property to a single child to change its alignment within its parent. `alignSelf` overrides any option set by the parent with `alignItems`.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

### Align Content

alignContent defines the distribution of lines along the cross-axis. This only has effect when items are wrapped to multiple lines using `flexWrap`.

- `flex-start` (**default value**) Align wrapped lines to the start of the container's cross axis.

- `flex-end` Align wrapped lines to the end of the container's cross axis.

- `stretch` (_default value when using Yoga on the web_) Stretch wrapped lines to match the height of the container's cross axis.

- `center` Align wrapped lines in the center of the container's cross axis.

- `space-between` Evenly space wrapped lines across the container's cross axis, distributing the remaining space between the lines.

- `space-around` Evenly space wrapped lines across the container's cross axis, distributing the remaining space around the lines. Each end of the container has a half-sized space compared to the space between items.

- `space-evenly` Evenly space wrapped lines across the container's cross axis, distributing the remaining space around the lines. Each space is the same size.

You can learn more here.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

### Flex Wrap

The `flexWrap` property is set on containers and it controls what happens when children overflow the size of the container along the main axis. By default, children are forced into a single line (which can shrink elements). If wrapping is allowed, items are wrapped into multiple lines along the main axis if needed.

When wrapping lines, `alignContent` can be used to specify how the lines are placed in the container. Learn more here.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

### Flex Basis, Grow, and Shrink

- `flexBasis` is an axis-independent way of providing the default size of an item along the main axis. Setting the `flexBasis` of a child is similar to setting the `width` of that child if its parent is a container with `flexDirection: row` or setting the `height` of a child if its parent is a container with `flexDirection: column`. The `flexBasis` of an item is the default size of that item, the size of the item before any `flexGrow` and `flexShrink` calculations are performed.

- `flexGrow` describes how much space within a container should be distributed among its children along the main axis. After laying out its children, a container will distribute any remaining space according to the flex grow values specified by its children.

  `flexGrow` accepts any floating point value >= 0, with 0 being the default value. A container will distribute any remaining space among its children weighted by the children’s `flexGrow` values.

- `flexShrink` describes how to shrink children along the main axis in the case in which the total size of the children overflows the size of the container on the main axis. `flexShrink` is very similar to `flexGrow` and can be thought of in the same way if any overflowing size is considered to be negative remaining space. These two properties also work well together by allowing children to grow and shrink as needed.

  `flexShrink` accepts any floating point value >= 0, with 0 being the default value (on the web, the default is 1). A container will shrink its children weighted by the children’s `flexShrink` values.

You can learn more here.

- JavaScript

### Row Gap, Column Gap and Gap

- `rowGap` sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's rows.

- `columnGap` sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's columns.

- `gap` sets the size of the gap (gutter) between rows and columns. It is a shorthand for `rowGap` and `columnGap`.

You can use `flexWrap` and `alignContent` along with `gap` to add consistent spacing between items.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

### Width and Height

The `width` property specifies the width of an element's content area. Similarly, the `height` property specifies the height of an element's content area.

Both `width` and `height` can take the following values:

- `auto` (**default value**) React Native calculates the width/height for the element based on its content, whether that is other children, text, or an image.

- `pixels` Defines the width/height in absolute pixels. Depending on other styles set on the component, this may or may not be the final dimension of the node.

- `percentage` Defines the width or height in percentage of its parent's width or height, respectively.

* TypeScript
* JavaScript

### Position

The `position` type of an element defines how it is positioned relative to either itself, its parent, or its containing block.

- `relative` (**default value**) By default, an element is positioned relatively. This means an element is positioned according to the normal flow of the layout, and then offset relative to that position based on the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. The offset does not affect the position of any sibling or parent elements.

- `absolute` When positioned absolutely, an element doesn't take part in the normal layout flow. It is instead laid out independent of its siblings. The position is determined based on the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` values. These values will position the element relative to its containing block.

- `static` When positioned statically, an element is positioned according to the normal flow of layout, and will ignore the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` values. This `position` will also cause the element to not form a containing block for absolute descendants, unless some other superceding style prop is present (e.g. `transform`). This allows `absolute` elements to be positioned to something that is not their parent. Note that **`static` is only available on the New Architecture**.

* TypeScript
* JavaScript

### The Containing Block

The containing block of an element is an ancestor element which controls its position and size. The way containing blocks work in React Native is very similar to how they work on the web, with some simplifications due to the lack of some web features.

The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` values of an absolutely positioned element will be relative to its containing block.

Percentage lengths (e.g.: `width: '50%'` or `padding: '10%'`) applied to absolutely positioned elements will be calculated relatively to the size of its containing block. For example, if the containing block is 100 points wide, then `width: 50%` on an absolutely positioned element will cause it to be 50 points wide.

The following list will help you determine the containing block of any given element:

- If that element has a `position` type of `relative` or `static`, then its containing block is its parent.

- If that element has a `position` type of `absolute`, then its containing block is the nearest ancestor in which one of the following is true:

  - It has a `position` type other than `static`
  - It has a `transform`

### Going Deeper

Check out the interactive yoga playground that you can use to get a better understanding of flexbox.

We've covered the basics, but there are many other styles you may need for layouts. The full list of props that control layout is documented here.

Additionally, you can see some examples from Wix Engineers.

## StatusBar

Component to control the app's status bar. The status bar is the zone, typically at the top of the screen, that displays the current time, Wi-Fi and cellular network information, battery level and/or other status icons.

#### Usage with Navigator

It is possible to have multiple `StatusBar` components mounted at the same time. The props will be merged in the order the `StatusBar` components were mounted.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

#### Imperative API

For cases where using a component is not ideal, there is also an imperative API exposed as static functions on the component. It is however not recommended to use the static API and the component for the same prop because any value set by the static API will get overridden by the one set by the component in the next render.

## Text

A React component for displaying text.

`Text` supports nesting, styling, and touch handling.

In the following example, the nested title and body text will inherit the `fontFamily` from `styles.baseText`, but the title provides its own additional styles. The title and body will stack on top of each other on account of the literal newlines:

### Nested text

Both Android and iOS allow you to display formatted text by annotating ranges of a string with specific formatting like bold or colored text (`NSAttributedString` on iOS, `SpannableString` on Android). In practice, this is very tedious. For React Native, we decided to use the web paradigm for this, where you can nest text to achieve the same effect.

Behind the scenes, React Native converts this to a flat `NSAttributedString` or `SpannableString` that contains the following information:

```
"I am bold and red"
0-9: bold
9-17: bold, red
```

### Containers

The `<Text>` element is unique relative to layout: everything inside is no longer using the Flexbox layout but using text layout. This means that elements inside of a `<Text>` are no longer rectangles, but wrap when they see the end of the line.

```
<Text>
  <Text>First part and </Text>
  <Text>second part</Text>
</Text>
// Text container: the text will be inline, if the space allows it
// |First part and second part|

// otherwise, the text will flow as if it was one
// |First part |
// |and second |
// |part       |

<View>
  <Text>First part and </Text>
  <Text>second part</Text>
</View>
// View container: each text is its own block
// |First part and|
// |second part   |

// otherwise, the text will flow in its own block
// |First part |
// |and        |
// |second part|
```

### Limited Style Inheritance

On the web, the usual way to set a font family and size for the entire document is to take advantage of inherited CSS properties like so:

css

```
html {
  font-family:
    'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 11px;
  color: #141823;
}
```

All elements in the document will inherit this font unless they or one of their parents specifies a new rule.

In React Native, we are more strict about it: **you must wrap all the text nodes inside of a `<Text>` component**. You cannot have a text node directly under a `<View>`.

```
// BAD: will raise exception, can't have a text node as child of a <View>
<View>
  Some text
</View>

// GOOD
<View>
  <Text>
    Some text
  </Text>
</View>
```

You also lose the ability to set up a default font for an entire subtree. Meanwhile, `fontFamily` only accepts a single font name, which is different from `font-family` in CSS. The recommended way to use consistent fonts and sizes across your application is to create a component `MyAppText` that includes them and use this component across your app. You can also use this component to make more specific components like `MyAppHeaderText` for other kinds of text.

```
<View>
  <MyAppText>
    Text styled with the default font for the entire application
  </MyAppText>
  <MyAppHeaderText>Text styled as a header</MyAppHeaderText>
</View>
```

Assuming that `MyAppText` is a component that only renders out its children into a `Text` component with styling, then `MyAppHeaderText` can be defined as follows:

```
const MyAppHeaderText = ({children}) => {
  return (
    <MyAppText>
      <Text style={{fontSize: 20}}>{children}</Text>
    </MyAppText>
  );
};
```

Composing `MyAppText` in this way ensures that we get the styles from a top-level component, but leaves us the ability to add/override them in specific use cases.

React Native still has the concept of style inheritance, but limited to text subtrees. In this case, the second part will be both bold and red.

```
<Text style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
  I am bold
  <Text style={{color: 'red'}}>and red</Text>
</Text>
```

We believe that this more constrained way to style text will yield better apps:

- (Developer) React components are designed with strong isolation in mind: You should be able to drop a component anywhere in your application, trusting that as long as the props are the same, it will look and behave the same way. Text properties that could inherit from outside of the props would break this isolation.

- (Implementor) The implementation of React Native is also simplified. We do not need to have a `fontFamily` field on every single element, and we do not need to potentially traverse the tree up to the root every time we display a text node. The style inheritance is only encoded inside of the native Text component and doesn't leak to other components or the system itself.

{
  lines: [
    TextLayout,
    TextLayout,
    // ...
  ];
  target: 1127;

## TextInput

A foundational component for inputting text into the app via a keyboard. Props provide configurability for several features, such as auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard types, such as a numeric keypad.

The most basic use case is to plop down a `TextInput` and subscribe to the `onChangeText` events to read the user input. There are also other events, such as `onSubmitEditing` and `onFocus` that can be subscribed to. A minimal example:

Two methods exposed via the native element are `.focus()` and `.blur()` that will focus or blur the TextInput programmatically.

Note that some props are only available with `multiline={true/false}`. Additionally, border styles that apply to only one side of the element (e.g., `borderBottomColor`, `borderLeftWidth`, etc.) will not be applied if `multiline=true`. To achieve the same effect, you can wrap your `TextInput` in a `View`:

`TextInput` has a border at the bottom of its view by default. This border has its padding set by the background image provided by the system, and it cannot be changed. Solutions to avoid this are to either not set height explicitly, in which case the system will take care of displaying the border in the correct position, or to not display the border by setting `underlineColorAndroid` to transparent.

Note that on Android performing text selection in an input can change the app's activity `windowSoftInputMode` param to `adjustResize`. This may cause issues with components that have position: 'absolute' while the keyboard is active. To avoid this behavior either specify `windowSoftInputMode` in AndroidManifest.xml ( <https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html> ) or control this param programmatically with native code.

---

#### `disableFullscreenUI`Android

When `false`, if there is a small amount of space available around a text input (e.g. landscape orientation on a phone), the OS may choose to have the user edit the text inside of a full screen text input mode.

Tells the operating system whether the individual fields in your app should be included in a view structure for autofill purposes on Android API Level 26+. Possible values are `auto`, `no`, `noExcludeDescendants`, `yes`, and `yesExcludeDescendants`. The default value is `auto`.

- `auto`: Let the Android System use its heuristics to determine if the view is important for autofill.
- `no`: This view isn't important for autofill.
- `noExcludeDescendants`: This view and its children aren't important for autofill.
- `yes`: This view is important for autofill.
- `yesExcludeDescendants`: This view is important for autofill, but its children aren't important for autofill.

| Type                                                                       |

#### `onKeyPress`

Callback that is called when a key is pressed. This will be called with object where `keyValue` is `'Enter'` or `'Backspace'` for respective keys and the typed-in character otherwise including `' '` for space. Fires before `onChange` callbacks. Note: on Android only the inputs from soft keyboard are handled, not the hardware keyboard inputs.

| Type                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- |

| string |

---

#### `placeholderTextColor`

The text color of the placeholder string.

#### `rejectResponderTermination`iOS

If `true`, allows TextInput to pass touch events to the parent component. This allows components such as SwipeableListView to be swipeable from the TextInput on iOS, as is the case on Android by default. If `false`, TextInput always asks to handle the input (except when disabled). The default value is `true`.

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

#### `rows`Android

Sets the number of lines for a `TextInput`. Use it with multiline set to `true` to be able to fill the lines.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

If `false`, scrolling of the text view will be disabled. The default value is `true`. Only works with `multiline={true}`.

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

#### `secureTextEntry`

If `true`, the text input obscures the text entered so that sensitive text like passwords stay secure. The default value is `false`. Does not work with `multiline={true}`.

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

#### `selection`

The start and end of the text input's selection. Set start and end to the same value to position the cursor.

---

#### `submitBehavior`

When the return key is pressed,

For single line inputs:

- `'newline'` defaults to `'blurAndSubmit'`
- `undefined` defaults to `'blurAndSubmit'`

For multiline inputs:

- `'newline'` adds a newline
- `undefined` defaults to `'newline'`

For both single line and multiline inputs:

- `'submit'` will only send a submit event and not blur the input
- `'blurAndSubmit`' will both blur the input and send a submit event

| Type                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| enum('submit', 'blurAndSubmit', 'newline') |

| ------------------------------- |
| enum('left', 'center', 'right') |

---

#### `textContentType`iOS

Give the keyboard and the system information about the expected semantic meaning for the content that users enter.

note

`autoComplete`, provides the same functionality and is available for all platforms. You can use `Platform.select` for differing platform behaviors.

Avoid using both `textContentType` and `autoComplete`. For backwards compatibility, `textContentType` takes precedence when both properties are set.

You can set `textContentType` to `username` or `password` to enable autofill of login details from the device keychain.

`newPassword` can be used to indicate a new password input the user may want to save in the keychain, and `oneTimeCode` can be used to indicate that a field can be autofilled by a code arriving in an SMS.

To disable autofill, set `textContentType` to `none`.

Possible values for `textContentType` are:

- `none`
- `addressCity`
- `addressCityAndState`
- `addressState`
- `birthdate` (iOS 17+)
- `birthdateDay` (iOS 17+)
- `birthdateMonth` (iOS 17+)

---

#### `passwordRules`iOS

When using `textContentType` as `newPassword` on iOS we can let the OS know the minimum requirements of the password so that it can generate one that will satisfy them. In order to create a valid string for `PasswordRules` take a look to the Apple Docs.

> If passwords generation dialog doesn't appear please make sure that:
>
> - AutoFill is enabled: **Settings** → **Passwords & Accounts** → toggle "On" the **AutoFill Passwords**,
> - iCloud Keychain is used: **Settings** → **Apple ID** → **iCloud** → **Keychain** → toggle "On" the **iCloud Keychain**.

- `borderBottomRightRadius`
- `borderBottomLeftRadius`

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `textBreakStrategy`Android

Set text break strategy on Android API Level 23+, possible values are `simple`, `highQuality`, `balanced` The default value is `highQuality`.

| Type                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- |
| enum('simple', 'highQuality', 'balanced') |

---

#### `underlineColorAndroid`Android

The color of the `TextInput` underline.

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `value`

The value to show for the text input. `TextInput` is a controlled component, which means the native value will be forced to match this value prop if provided. For most uses, this works great, but in some cases this may cause flickering - one common cause is preventing edits by keeping value the same. In addition to setting the same value, either set `editable={false}`, or set/update `maxLength` to prevent unwanted edits without flicker.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

#### `lineBreakStrategyIOS`iOS

Set line break strategy on iOS 14+. Possible values are `none`, `standard`, `hangul-word` and `push-out`.

| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum(`'none'`, `'standard'`, `'hangul-word'`, `'push-out'`) | `'none'` |

---

#### `disableKeyboardShortcuts`iOS

If `true`, the keyboard shortcuts (undo/redo and copy buttons) are disabled. The default value is `false`.

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

### Methods

#### `.focus()`

```
focus();
```

Makes the native input request focus.

#### `.blur()`

```
blur();
```

Makes the native input lose focus.

#### `clear()`

```
clear();
```

Removes all text from the `TextInput`.

---

#### `isFocused()`

```
isFocused(): boolean;
```

Returns `true` if the input is currently focused; `false` otherwise.

### Known issues

- react-native#19096: Doesn't support Android's `onKeyPreIme`.
- react-native#19366: Calling .focus() after closing Android's keyboard via back button doesn't bring keyboard up again.
- react-native#26799: Doesn't support Android's `secureTextEntry` when `keyboardType="email-address"` or `keyboardType="phone-pad"`.

## Images

### Static Image Resources

React Native provides a unified way of managing images and other media assets in your Android and iOS apps. To add a static image to your app, place it somewhere in your source code tree and reference it like this:

```
<Image source={require('./my-icon.png')} />
```

The image name is resolved the same way JS modules are resolved. In the example above, the bundler will look for `my-icon.png` in the same folder as the component that requires it.

You can use the `@2x` and `@3x` suffixes to provide images for different screen densities. If you have the following file structure:

```
.
├── button.js
└── img
    ├── check.png
    ├── check@2x.png
    └── check@3x.png
```

...and `button.js` code contains:

```
<Image source={require('./img/check.png')} />
```

...the bundler will bundle and serve the image corresponding to device's screen density. For example, `check@2x.png`, will be used on an iPhone 7, while`check@3x.png` will be used on an iPhone 7 Plus or a Nexus 5. If there is no image matching the screen density, the closest best option will be selected.

On Windows, you might need to restart the bundler if you add new images to your project.

Here are some benefits that you get:

1. Same system on Android and iOS.
2. Images live in the same folder as your JavaScript code. Components are self-contained.
3. No global namespace, i.e. you don't have to worry about name collisions.
4. Only the images that are actually used will be packaged into your app.
5. Adding and changing images doesn't require app recompilation, you can refresh the simulator as you normally do.
6. The bundler knows the image dimensions, no need to duplicate it in the code.
7. Images can be distributed via npm packages.

In order for this to work, the image name in `require` has to be known statically.

```
// GOOD
<Image source={require('./my-icon.png')} />;

// BAD
const icon = this.props.active
  ? 'my-icon-active'
  : 'my-icon-inactive';
<Image source={require('./' + icon + '.png')} />;

// GOOD
const icon = this.props.active
  ? require('./my-icon-active.png')
  : require('./my-icon-inactive.png');
<Image source={icon} />;
```

Note that image sources required this way include size (width, height) info for the Image. If you need to scale the image dynamically (i.e. via flex), you may need to manually set `{width: undefined, height: undefined}` on the style attribute.

### Static Non-Image Resources

The `require` syntax described above can be used to statically include audio, video or document files in your project as well. Most common file types are supported including `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.html` and `.pdf`. See bundler defaults for the full list.

You can add support for other types by adding an `assetExts` resolver option in your Metro configuration.

A caveat is that videos must use absolute positioning instead of `flexGrow`, since size info is not currently passed for non-image assets. This limitation doesn't occur for videos that are linked directly into Xcode or the Assets folder for Android.

### Images From Hybrid App's Resources

If you are building a hybrid app (some UIs in React Native, some UIs in platform code) you can still use images that are already bundled into the app.

For images included via Xcode asset catalogs or in the Android drawable folder, use the image name without the extension:

```
<Image
  source={{uri: 'app_icon'}}
  style={{width: 40, height: 40}}
/>
```

For images in the Android assets folder, use the `asset:/` scheme:

```
<Image
  source={{uri: 'asset:/app_icon.png'}}
  style={{width: 40, height: 40}}
/>
```

These approaches provide no safety checks. It's up to you to guarantee that those images are available in the application. Also you have to specify image dimensions manually.

### Network Images

Many of the images you will display in your app will not be available at compile time, or you will want to load some dynamically to keep the binary size down. Unlike with static resources, _you will need to manually specify the dimensions of your image_. It's highly recommended that you use https as well in order to satisfy App Transport Security requirements on iOS.

```
// GOOD
<Image source={{uri: 'https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png'}}
       style={{width: 400, height: 400}} />

// BAD
<Image source={{uri: 'https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png'}} />
```

#### Network Requests for Images

If you would like to set such things as the HTTP-Verb, Headers or a Body along with the image request, you may do this by defining these properties on the source object:

```
<Image
  source={{
    uri: 'https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png',
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Pragma: 'no-cache',
    },
    body: 'Your Body goes here',
  }}
  style={{width: 400, height: 400}}
/>
```

### URI Data Images

Sometimes, you might be getting encoded image data from a REST API call. You can use the `'data:'` URI scheme to use these images. Same as for network resources, _you will need to manually specify the dimensions of your image_.

info

This is recommended for very small and dynamic images only, like icons in a list from a DB.

```
// include at least width and height!
<Image
  style={{
    width: 51,
    height: 51,
    resizeMode: 'contain',

#### Cache Control

In some cases you might only want to display an image if it is already in the local cache, i.e. a low resolution placeholder until a higher resolution is available. In other cases you do not care if the image is outdated and are willing to display an outdated image to save bandwidth. The `cache` source property gives you control over how the network layer interacts with the cache.

- `default`: Use the native platforms default strategy.
- `reload`: The data for the URL will be loaded from the originating source. No existing cache data should be used to satisfy a URL load request.
- `force-cache`: The existing cached data will be used to satisfy the request, regardless of its age or expiration date. If there is no existing data in the cache corresponding the request, the data is loaded from the originating source.
- `only-if-cached`: The existing cache data will be used to satisfy a request, regardless of its age or expiration date. If there is no existing data in the cache corresponding to a URL load request, no attempt is made to load the data from the originating source, and the load is considered to have failed.

```
<Image
  source={{
    uri: 'https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png',
    cache: 'only-if-cached',
  }}
  style={{width: 400, height: 400}}
/>
```

### Local Filesystem Images

See CameraRoll for an example of using local resources that are outside of `Images.xcassets`.

#### Drawable resources

Android supports loading drawable resources via the `xml` file type. This means you can use vector drawables for rendering icons or shape drawables for, well, drawing shapes! You can import and use these resource types the same as any other static resource or hybrid resource. You have to specify image dimensions manually.

For static drawables that live alongside your JS code, use the `require` or `import` syntax (both work the same):

```
<Image
  source={require('./img/my_icon.xml')}
  style={{width: 40, height: 40}}
/>
```

For drawables included in the Android drawable folder (i.e. `res/drawable`), use the resource name without the extension:

```
<Image
  source={{uri: 'my_icon'}}
  style={{width: 40, height: 40}}
/>
```

The one key difference between drawable resources and other image types is that the asset must be referenced at compile-time of the Android application as Android needs to run the Android Asset Packaging Tool (AAPT) to package the asset. Binary XML, the file format AAPT creates, cannot be loaded over the network by Metro. If you change the directory or name of an asset, you will need to rebuild the Android application each time.

##### Creating XML drawable resources

Android provides comprehensive documentation on each of the supported drawable resource types in its Drawable resources guide, along with examples of raw XML files. You can utilize tools from Android Studio like the Vector Asset Studio to create vector drawables from Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) and Adobe Photoshop Document (PSD) files.

info

You should try to avoid referencing other resources in the XML file you create if you want to treat your XML file as a static image resource (i.e. with an `import` or `require` statement). If you wish to utilize references to other drawables or attributes, like color state lists or dimension resources, you should include your drawable as a hybrid resource and import it by name.

#### Best Camera Roll Image

iOS saves multiple sizes for the same image in your Camera Roll, it is very important to pick the one that's as close as possible for performance reasons. You wouldn't want to use the full quality 3264x2448 image as source when displaying a 200x200 thumbnail. If there's an exact match, React Native will pick it, otherwise it's going to use the first one that's at least 50% bigger in order to avoid blur when resizing from a close size. All of this is done by default so you don't have to worry about writing the tedious (and error prone) code to do it yourself.

### Why Not Automatically Size Everything?

_In the browser_ if you don't give a size to an image, the browser is going to render a 0x0 element, download the image, and then render the image based with the correct size. The big issue with this behavior is that your UI is going to jump all around as images load, this makes for a very bad user experience. This is called Cumulative Layout Shift.

_In React Native_ this behavior is intentionally not implemented. It is more work for the developer to know the dimensions (or aspect ratio) of the remote image in advance, but we believe that it leads to a better user experience. Static images loaded from the app bundle via the `require('./my-icon.png')` syntax _can be automatically sized_ because their dimensions are available immediately at the time of mounting.

For example, the result of `require('./my-icon.png')` might be:

```
{"__packager_asset":true,"uri":"my-icon.png","width":591,"height":573}
```

### Source as an object

In React Native, one interesting decision is that the `src` attribute is named `source` and doesn't take a string but an object with a `uri` attribute.

```
<Image source={{uri: 'something.jpg'}} />
```

On the infrastructure side, the reason is that it allows us to attach metadata to this object. For example if you are using `require('./my-icon.png')`, then we add information about its actual location and size (don't rely on this fact, it might change in the future!). This is also future proofing, for example we may want to support sprites at some point, instead of outputting `{uri: ...}`, we can output `{uri: ..., crop: {left: 10, top: 50, width: 20, height: 40}}` and transparently support spriting on all the existing call sites.

On the user side, this lets you annotate the object with useful attributes such as the dimension of the image in order to compute the size it's going to be displayed in. Feel free to use it as your data structure to store more information about your image.

### Background Image via Nesting

A common feature request from developers familiar with the web is `background-image`. To handle this use case, you can use the `<ImageBackground>` component, which has the same props as `<Image>`, and add whatever children to it you would like to layer on top of it.

You might not want to use `<ImageBackground>` in some cases, since the implementation is basic. Refer to `<ImageBackground>`'s documentation for more insight, and create your own custom component when needed.

```
return (
  <ImageBackground source={...} style={{width: '100%', height: '100%'}}>
    <Text>Inside</Text>
  </ImageBackground>
);
```

Note that you must specify some width and height style attributes.

### iOS Border Radius Styles

Please note that the following corner specific, border radius style properties might be ignored by iOS's image component:

- `borderTopLeftRadius`
- `borderTopRightRadius`
- `borderBottomLeftRadius`
- `borderBottomRightRadius`

### Off-thread Decoding

Image decoding can take more than a frame-worth of time. This is one of the major sources of frame drops on the web because decoding is done in the main thread. In React Native, image decoding is done in a different thread. In practice, you already need to handle the case when the image is not downloaded yet, so displaying the placeholder for a few more frames while it is decoding does not require any code change.

### Configuring iOS Image Cache Limits

On iOS, we expose an API to override React Native's default image cache limits. This should be called from within your native AppDelegate code (e.g. within `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`).

objectivec

```
RCTSetImageCacheLimits(4*1024*1024, 200*1024*1024);
```

**Parameters:**

| Name           | Type   | Required | Description             |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------- |
| imageSizeLimit | number | Yes      | Image cache size limit. |
| totalCostLimit | number | Yes      | Total cache cost limit. |

In the above code example the image size limit is set to 4 MB and the total cost limit is set to 200 MB.

## TouchableHighlight

> If you're looking for a more extensive and future-proof way to handle touch-based input, check out the Pressable API.

A wrapper for making views respond properly to touches. On press down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, which allows the underlay color to show through, darkening or tinting the view.

The underlay comes from wrapping the child in a new View, which can affect layout, and sometimes cause unwanted visual artifacts if not used correctly, for example if the backgroundColor of the wrapped view isn't explicitly set to an opaque color.

TouchableHighlight must have one child (not zero or more than one). If you wish to have several child components, wrap them in a View.

```
function MyComponent(props: MyComponentProps) {
  return (
    <View {...props} style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#fff'}}>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

<TouchableHighlight
  activeOpacity={0.6}
  underlayColor="#DDDDDD"
  onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>
  <MyComponent />
</TouchableHighlight>;
```

## Handling Touches

Users interact with mobile apps mainly through touch. They can use a combination of gestures, such as tapping on a button, scrolling a list, or zooming on a map. React Native provides components to handle all sorts of common gestures, as well as a comprehensive gesture responder system to allow for more advanced gesture recognition, but the one component you will most likely be interested in is the basic Button.

### Displaying a basic button

Button provides a basic button component that is rendered nicely on all platforms. The minimal example to display a button looks like this:

```
<Button
  onPress={() => {
    console.log('You tapped the button!');
  }}
  title="Press Me"
/>
```

This will render a blue label on iOS, and a blue rounded rectangle with light text on Android. Pressing the button will call the "onPress" function, which in this case displays an alert popup. If you like, you can specify a "color" prop to change the color of your button.

Go ahead and play around with the `Button` component using the example below. You can select which platform your app is previewed in by clicking on the toggle in the bottom right and then clicking on "Tap to Play" to preview the app.

### Touchables

If the basic button doesn't look right for your app, you can build your own button using any of the "Touchable" components provided by React Native. These components provide the capability to capture tapping gestures and can display feedback when a gesture is recognized. However, these components do not provide any default styling, so you will need to do a bit of work to get them looking nice in your app.

Which "Touchable" component you use will depend on what kind of feedback you want to provide:

- Generally, you can use **TouchableHighlight** anywhere you would use a button or link on web. The view's background will be darkened when the user presses down on the button.

- You may consider using **TouchableNativeFeedback** on Android to display ink surface reaction ripples that respond to the user's touch.

- **TouchableOpacity** can be used to provide feedback by reducing the opacity of the button, allowing the background to be seen through while the user is pressing down.

- If you need to handle a tap gesture but you don't want any feedback to be displayed, use **TouchableWithoutFeedback**.

In some cases, you may want to detect when a user presses and holds a view for a set amount of time. These long presses can be handled by passing a function to the `onLongPress` props of any of the "Touchable" components.

Let's see all of these in action:

### Scrolling and swiping

Gestures commonly used on devices with touchable screens include swipes and pans. These allow the user to scroll through a list of items, or swipe through pages of content. For these, check out the ScrollView Core Component.

### Known issues

- react-native#29308: The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and on Android negative margin is not supported.

## TouchableWithoutFeedback

> If you're looking for a more extensive and future-proof way to handle touch-based input, check out the Pressable API.

Do not use unless you have a very good reason. All elements that respond to press should have a visual feedback when touched.

`TouchableWithoutFeedback` supports only one child. If you wish to have several child components, wrap them in a View. Importantly, `TouchableWithoutFeedback` works by cloning its child and applying responder props to it. It is therefore required that any intermediary components pass through those props to the underlying React Native component.

### Usage Pattern

```
function MyComponent(props: MyComponentProps) {
  return (
    <View {...props} style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#fff'}}>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

<TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>
  <MyComponent />
</TouchableWithoutFeedback>;
```

## Navigating Between Screens

Mobile apps are rarely made up of a single screen. Managing the presentation of, and transition between, multiple screens is typically handled by what is known as a navigator.

This guide covers the various navigation components available in React Native. If you are getting started with navigation, you will probably want to use React Navigation. React Navigation provides a straightforward navigation solution, with the ability to present common stack navigation and tabbed navigation patterns on both Android and iOS.

If you're integrating React Native into an app that already manages navigation natively, or looking for an alternative to React Navigation, the following library provides native navigation on both platforms: react-native-navigation.

### React Navigation

The community solution to navigation is a standalone library that allows developers to set up the screens of an app with a few lines of code.

#### Installation and setup

First, you need to install them in your project:

shell

```
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
```

Next, install the required peer dependencies. You need to run different commands depending on whether your project is an Expo managed project or a bare React Native project.

- If you have an Expo managed project, install the dependencies with `expo`:

  shell

  ```
  npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
  ```

- If you have a bare React Native project, install the dependencies with `npm`:

  shell

  ```
  npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
  ```

  For iOS with bare React Native project, make sure you have CocoaPods installed. Then install the pods to complete the installation:

  shell

  ```
  cd ios
  pod install
  cd ..
  ```

note

You might get warnings related to peer dependencies after installation. They are usually caused by incorrect version ranges specified in some packages. You can safely ignore most warnings as long as your app builds.

Now, you need to wrap the whole app in `NavigationContainer`. Usually you'd do this in your entry file, such as `index.js` or `App.js`:

```
import * as React from 'react';
import {NavigationContainer} from '@react-navigation/native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      {/* Rest of your app code */}
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Now you are ready to build and run your app on the device/simulator.

#### Usage

Now you can create an app with a home screen and a profile screen:

```
import * as React from 'react';
import {NavigationContainer} from '@react-navigation/native';
import {createNativeStackNavigator} from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

const MyStack = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen
          name="Home"
          component={HomeScreen}
          options={{title: 'Welcome'}}
        />
        <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};
```

In this example, there are 2 screens (`Home` and `Profile`) defined using the `Stack.Screen` component. Similarly, you can define as many screens as you like.

You can set options such as the screen title for each screen in the `options` prop of `Stack.Screen`.

Each screen takes a `component` prop that is a React component. Those components receive a prop called `navigation` which has various methods to link to other screens. For example, you can use `navigation.navigate` to go to the `Profile` screen:

```
const HomeScreen = ({navigation}) => {
  return (
    <Button
      title="Go to Jane's profile"
      onPress={() =>
        navigation.navigate('Profile', {name: 'Jane'})
      }
    />
  );
};
const ProfileScreen = ({navigation, route}) => {
  return <Text>This is {route.params.name}'s profile</Text>;
};
```

This `native-stack` navigator uses the native APIs: `UINavigationController` on iOS and `Fragment` on Android so that navigation built with `createNativeStackNavigator` will behave the same and have the same performance characteristics as apps built natively on top of those APIs.

React Navigation also has packages for different kind of navigators such as tabs and drawer. You can use them to implement various patterns in your app.

For a complete intro to React Navigation, follow the React Navigation Getting Started Guide.

## Core Components and APIs

React Native provides a number of built-in Core Components ready for you to use in your app. You can find them all in the left sidebar (or menu above, if you are on a narrow screen). If you're not sure where to get started, take a look at the following categories:

-
-
-
-
-
-

You're not limited to the components and APIs bundled with React Native. React Native has a community of thousands of developers. If you're looking for a library that does something specific, please refer to this guide about finding libraries.

### Basic Components

Most apps will end up using one or more of these basic components.

### User Interface

These common user interface controls will render on any platform.

### List Views

Unlike the more generic `ScrollView`, the following list view components only render elements that are currently showing on the screen. This makes them a performant choice for displaying long lists of data.

### Android Components and APIs

Many of the following components provide wrappers for commonly used Android classes.

### iOS Components and APIs

Many of the following components provide wrappers for commonly used UIKit classes.

### Others

These components may be useful for certain applications. For an exhaustive list of components and APIs, check out the sidebar to the left (or menu above, if you are on a narrow screen).

## Animations

Animations are very important to create a great user experience. Stationary objects must overcome inertia as they start moving. Objects in motion have momentum and rarely come to a stop immediately. Animations allow you to convey physically believable motion in your interface.

React Native provides two complementary animation systems: `Animated` for granular and interactive control of specific values, and `LayoutAnimation` for animated global layout transactions.

### `Animated` API

The `Animated` API is designed to concisely express a wide variety of interesting animation and interaction patterns in a very performant way. `Animated` focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, with configurable transforms in between, and `start`/`stop` methods to control time-based animation execution.

`Animated` exports six animatable component types: `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `ScrollView`, `FlatList` and `SectionList`, but you can also create your own using `Animated.createAnimatedComponent()`.

For example, a container view that fades in when it is mounted may look like this:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

Let's break down what's happening here. In the `FadeInView` render method, a new `Animated.Value` called `fadeAnim` is initialized with `useRef`. The opacity property on the `View` is mapped to this animated value. Behind the scenes, the numeric value is extracted and used to set opacity.

When the component mounts, the opacity is set to 0. Then, an easing animation is started on the `fadeAnim` animated value, which will update all of its dependent mappings (in this case, only the opacity) on each frame as the value animates to the final value of 1.

This is done in an optimized way that is faster than calling `setState` and re-rendering. Because the entire configuration is declarative, we will be able to implement further optimizations that serialize the configuration and runs the animation on a high-priority thread.

#### Configuring animations

Animations are heavily configurable. Custom and predefined easing functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.

`Animated` provides several animation types, the most commonly used one being `Animated.timing()`. It supports animating a value over time using one of various predefined easing functions, or you can use your own. Easing functions are typically used in animation to convey gradual acceleration and deceleration of objects.

By default, `timing` will use an easeInOut curve that conveys gradual acceleration to full speed and concludes by gradually decelerating to a stop. You can specify a different easing function by passing an `easing` parameter. Custom `duration` or even a `delay` before the animation starts is also supported.

For example, if we want to create a 2-second long animation of an object that slightly backs up before moving to its final position:

```
Animated.timing(this.state.xPosition, {
  toValue: 100,
  easing: Easing.back(),
  duration: 2000,
  useNativeDriver: true,
}).start();
```

Take a look at the Configuring animations section of the `Animated` API reference to learn more about all the config parameters supported by the built-in animations.

#### Composing animations

Animations can be combined and played in sequence or in parallel. Sequential animations can play immediately after the previous animation has finished, or they can start after a specified delay. The `Animated` API provides several methods, such as `sequence()` and `delay()`, each of which take an array of animations to execute and automatically calls `start()`/`stop()` as needed.

For example, the following animation coasts to a stop, then it springs back while twirling in parallel:

```
Animated.sequence([
  // decay, then spring to start and twirl
  Animated.decay(position, {
    // coast to a stop
    velocity: {x: gestureState.vx, y: gestureState.vy}, // velocity from gesture release
    deceleration: 0.997,
    useNativeDriver: true,
  }),
  Animated.parallel([
    // after decay, in parallel:
    Animated.spring(position, {
      toValue: {x: 0, y: 0}, // return to start
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }),
    Animated.timing(twirl, {
      // and twirl
      toValue: 360,
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }),
  ]),
]).start(); // start the sequence group
```

If one animation is stopped or interrupted, then all other animations in the group are also stopped. `Animated.parallel` has a `stopTogether` option that can be set to `false` to disable this.

You can find a full list of composition methods in the Composing animations section of the `Animated` API reference.

#### Combining animated values

You can combine two animated values via addition, multiplication, division, or modulo to make a new animated value.

There are some cases where an animated value needs to invert another animated value for calculation. An example is inverting a scale (2x There are some cases where an animated value needs to invert another animated value for calculation. An example is inverting a scale (2x --> 0.5x):

```
const a = new Animated.Value(1);
const b = Animated.divide(1, a);

Animated.spring(a, {
  toValue: 2,
  useNativeDriver: true,
}).start();
```

#### Interpolation

Each property can be run through an interpolation first. An interpolation maps input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but also supports easing functions. By default, it will extrapolate the curve beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.

A basic mapping to convert a 0-1 range to a 0-100 range would be:

```
value.interpolate({
  inputRange: [0, 1],
  outputRange: [0, 100],
});
```

For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to 1. This can be done by modifying `style` from the example above like so:

```
  style={{
    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly
    transform: [{
      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({
        inputRange: [0, 1],
        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0
      }),
    }],
  }}
```

`interpolate()` supports multiple range segments as well, which is handy for defining dead zones and other handy tricks. For example, to get a negation relationship at -300 that goes to 0 at -100, then back up to 1 at 0, and then back down to zero at 100 followed by a dead-zone that remains at 0 for everything beyond that, you could do:

```
value.interpolate({
  inputRange: [-300, -100, 0, 100, 101],
  outputRange: [300, 0, 1, 0, 0],
});
```

Which would map like so:

```
Input | Output
------|-------
  -400|    450
  -300|    300
  -200|    150
  -100|      0
   -50|    0.5
     0|      1
    50|    0.5
   100|      0
   101|      0
   200|      0
```

`interpolate()` also supports mapping to strings, allowing you to animate colors as well as values with units. For example, if you wanted to animate a rotation you could do:

```
value.interpolate({
  inputRange: [0, 360],
  outputRange: ['0deg', '360deg'],
});
```

`interpolate()` also supports arbitrary easing functions, many of which are already implemented in the `Easing` module. `interpolate()` also has configurable behavior for extrapolating the `outputRange`. You can set the extrapolation by setting the `extrapolate`, `extrapolateLeft`, or `extrapolateRight` options. The default value is `extend` but you can use `clamp` to prevent the output value from exceeding `outputRange`.

#### Tracking dynamic values

Animated values can also track other values by setting the `toValue` of an animation to another animated value instead of a plain number. For example, a "Chat Heads" animation like the one used by Messenger on Android could be implemented with a `spring()` pinned on another animated value, or with `timing()` and a `duration` of 0 for rigid tracking. They can also be composed with interpolations:

```
Animated.spring(follower, {toValue: leader}).start();
Animated.timing(opacity, {
  toValue: pan.x.interpolate({
    inputRange: [0, 300],
    outputRange: [1, 0],
  }),
  useNativeDriver: true,
}).start();
```

The `leader` and `follower` animated values would be implemented using `Animated.ValueXY()`. `ValueXY` is a handy way to deal with 2D interactions, such as panning or dragging. It is a basic wrapper that contains two `Animated.Value` instances and some helper functions that call through to them, making `ValueXY` a drop-in replacement for `Value` in many cases. It allows us to track both x and y values in the example above.

#### Tracking gestures

Gestures, like panning or scrolling, and other events can map directly to animated values using `Animated.event`. This is done with a structured map syntax so that values can be extracted from complex event objects. The first level is an array to allow mapping across multiple args, and that array contains nested objects.

For example, when working with horizontal scrolling gestures, you would do the following in order to map `event.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x` to `scrollX` (an `Animated.Value`):

```
 onScroll={Animated.event(
   // scrollX = e.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x
   [{nativeEvent: {
        contentOffset: {
          x: scrollX
        }
      }
    }]
 )}
```

The following example implements a horizontal scrolling carousel where the scroll position indicators are animated using the `Animated.event` used in the `ScrollView`

##### ScrollView with Animated Event Example

When using `PanResponder`, you could use the following code to extract the x and y positions from `gestureState.dx` and `gestureState.dy`. We use a `null` in the first position of the array, as we are only interested in the second argument passed to the `PanResponder` handler, which is the `gestureState`.

```
onPanResponderMove={Animated.event(
  [null, // ignore the native event
  // extract dx and dy from gestureState
  // like 'pan.x = gestureState.dx, pan.y = gestureState.dy'
  {dx: pan.x, dy: pan.y}
])}
```

##### PanResponder with Animated Event Example

#### Responding to the current animation value

You may notice that there is no clear way to read the current value while animating. This is because the value may only be known in the native runtime due to optimizations. If you need to run JavaScript in response to the current value, there are two approaches:

- `spring.stopAnimation(callback)` will stop the animation and invoke `callback` with the final value. This is useful when making gesture transitions.
- `spring.addListener(callback)` will invoke `callback` asynchronously while the animation is running, providing a recent value. This is useful for triggering state changes, for example snapping a bobble to a new option as the user drags it closer, because these larger state changes are less sensitive to a few frames of lag compared to continuous gestures like panning which need to run at 60 fps.

`Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system. Check out `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance implications in the future.

#### Using the native driver

The `Animated` API is designed to be serializable. By using the native driver, we send everything about the animation to native before starting the animation, allowing native code to perform the animation on the UI thread without having to go through the bridge on every frame. Once the animation has started, the JS thread can be blocked without affecting the animation.

Using the native driver for normal animations can be accomplished by setting `useNativeDriver: true` in animation config when starting it. Animations without a `useNativeDriver` property will default to false for legacy reasons, but emit a warning (and typechecking error in TypeScript).

```
Animated.timing(this.state.animatedValue, {
  toValue: 1,
  duration: 500,
  useNativeDriver: true, // <-- Set this to true
}).start();
```

Animated values are only compatible with one driver so if you use native driver when starting an animation on a value, make sure every animation on that value also uses the native driver.

The native driver also works with `Animated.event`. This is especially useful for animations that follow the scroll position as without the native driver, the animation will always run a frame behind the gesture due to the async nature of React Native.

```
<Animated.ScrollView // <-- Use the Animated ScrollView wrapper
  onScroll={Animated.event(
    [
      {
        nativeEvent: {
          contentOffset: {y: this.state.animatedValue},
        },
      },
    ],
    {useNativeDriver: true}, // <-- Set this to true
  )}>
  {content}
</Animated.ScrollView>
```

You can see the native driver in action by running the RNTester app, then loading the Native Animated Example. You can also take a look at the source code to learn how these examples were produced.

##### Caveats

Not everything you can do with `Animated` is currently supported by the native driver. The main limitation is that you can only animate non-layout properties: things like `transform` and `opacity` will work, but Flexbox and position properties will not. When using `Animated.event`, it will only work with direct events and not bubbling events. This means it does not work with `PanResponder` but does work with things like `ScrollView#onScroll`.

When an animation is running, it can prevent `VirtualizedList` components from rendering more rows. If you need to run a long or looping animation while the user is scrolling through a list, you can use `isInteraction: false` in your animation's config to prevent this issue.

#### Bear in mind

While using transform styles such as `rotateY`, `rotateX`, and others ensure the transform style `perspective` is in place. At this time some animations may not render on Android without it. Example below.

```
<Animated.View
  style={{
    transform: [
      {scale: this.state.scale},
      {rotateY: this.state.rotateY},
      {perspective: 1000}, // without this line this Animation will not render on Android while working fine on iOS
    ],
  }}
/>
```

#### Additional examples

The RNTester app has various examples of `Animated` in use:

-
-

### `LayoutAnimation` API

`LayoutAnimation` allows you to globally configure `create` and `update` animations that will be used for all views in the next render/layout cycle. This is useful for doing Flexbox layout updates without bothering to measure or calculate specific properties in order to animate them directly, and is especially useful when layout changes may affect ancestors, for example a "see more" expansion that also increases the size of the parent and pushes down the row below which would otherwise require explicit coordination between the components in order to animate them all in sync.

Note that although `LayoutAnimation` is very powerful and can be quite useful, it provides much less control than `Animated` and other animation libraries, so you may need to use another approach if you can't get `LayoutAnimation` to do what you want.

Note that in order to get this to work on **Android** you need to set the following flags via `UIManager`:

```
UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true);
```

This example uses a preset value, you can customize the animations as you need, see LayoutAnimation.js for more information.

### Additional notes

#### `requestAnimationFrame`

`requestAnimationFrame` is a polyfill from the browser that you might be familiar with. It accepts a function as its only argument and calls that function before the next repaint. It is an essential building block for animations that underlies all of the JavaScript-based animation APIs. In general, you shouldn't need to call this yourself - the animation APIs will manage frame updates for you.

#### `setNativeProps`

As mentioned in the Direct Manipulation section, `setNativeProps` allows us to modify properties of native-backed components (components that are actually backed by native views, unlike composite components) directly, without having to `setState` and re-render the component hierarchy.

We could use this in the Rebound example to update the scale - this might be helpful if the component that we are updating is deeply nested and hasn't been optimized with `shouldComponentUpdate`.

If you find your animations with dropping frames (performing below 60 frames per second), look into using `setNativeProps` or `shouldComponentUpdate` to optimize them. Or you could run the animations on the UI thread rather than the JavaScript thread with the useNativeDriver option. You may also want to defer any computationally intensive work until after animations are complete, using the InteractionManager. You can monitor the frame rate by using the In-App Dev Menu "FPS Monitor" tool.

## Gesture Responder System

The gesture responder system manages the lifecycle of gestures in your app. A touch can go through several phases as the app determines what the user's intention is. For example, the app needs to determine if the touch is scrolling, sliding on a widget, or tapping. This can even change during the duration of a touch. There can also be multiple simultaneous touches.

The touch responder system is needed to allow components to negotiate these touch interactions without any additional knowledge about their parent or child components.

#### Best Practices

To make your app feel great, every action should have the following attributes:

- Feedback/highlighting- show the user what is handling their touch, and what will happen when they release the gesture
- Cancel-ability- when making an action, the user should be able to abort it mid-touch by dragging their finger away

These features make users more comfortable while using an app, because it allows people to experiment and interact without fear of making mistakes.

#### TouchableHighlight and Touchable\*

The responder system can be complicated to use. So we have provided an abstract `Touchable` implementation for things that should be "tappable". This uses the responder system and allows you to configure tap interactions declaratively. Use `TouchableHighlight` anywhere where you would use a button or link on web.

### Responder Lifecycle

A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods. There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:

- `View.props.onStartShouldSetResponder: evt => true,` - Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
- `View.props.onMoveShouldSetResponder: evt => true,` - Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?

If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:

- `View.props.onResponderGrant: evt => {}` - The View is now responding for touch events. This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
- `View.props.onResponderReject: evt => {}` - Something else is the responder right now and will not release it

If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:

- `View.props.onResponderMove: evt => {}` - The user is moving their finger
- `View.props.onResponderRelease: evt => {}` - Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
- `View.props.onResponderTerminationRequest: evt => true` - Something else wants to become responder. Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
- `View.props.onResponderTerminate: evt => {}` - The responder has been taken from the View. Might be taken by other views after a call to `onResponderTerminationRequest`, or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)

`evt` is a synthetic touch event with the following form:

- `nativeEvent`

  - `changedTouches` - Array of all touch events that have changed since the last event
  - `identifier` - The ID of the touch
  - `locationX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the element
  - `locationY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the element
  - `pageX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the root element
  - `pageY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the root element
  - `target` - The node id of the element receiving the touch event
  - `timestamp` - A time identifier for the touch, useful for velocity calculation
  - `touches` - Array of all current touches on the screen

#### Capture ShouldSet Handlers

`onStartShouldSetResponder` and `onMoveShouldSetResponder` are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for `*ShouldSetResponder` handlers. This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.

However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder. This can be handled by using the capture phase. Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component, it will do a capture phase, firing `on*ShouldSetResponderCapture`. So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have a `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture` handler which returns true.

- `View.props.onStartShouldSetResponderCapture: evt => true,`
- `View.props.onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture: evt => true,`

## DrawerLayoutAndroid

React component that wraps the platform `DrawerLayout` (Android only). The Drawer (typically used for navigation) is rendered with `renderNavigationView` and direct children are the main view (where your content goes).

## TouchableNativeFeedback

> If you're looking for a more extensive and future-proof way to handle touch-based input, check out the Pressable API.

A wrapper for making views respond properly to touches (Android only). On Android this component uses native state drawable to display touch feedback.

At the moment it only supports having a single View instance as a child node, as it's implemented by replacing that View with another instance of RCTView node with some additional properties set.

Background drawable of native feedback touchable can be customized with `background` property.

Set to true to add the ripple effect to the foreground of the view, instead of the background. This is useful if one of your child views has a background of its own, or you're e.g. displaying images, and you don't want the ripple to be covered by them.

Check TouchableNativeFeedback.canUseNativeForeground() first, as this is only available on Android 6.0 and above. If you try to use this on older versions you will get a warning and fallback to background.

### Methods

#### `SelectableBackground()`

```
static SelectableBackground(
  rippleRadius: number | null,
): ThemeAttributeBackgroundPropType;
```

Creates an object that represents android theme's default background for selectable elements (`?android:attr/selectableItemBackground`). `rippleRadius` parameter controls the radius of the ripple effect.

---

#### `SelectableBackgroundBorderless()`

```
static SelectableBackgroundBorderless(
  rippleRadius: number | null,
): ThemeAttributeBackgroundPropType;
```

Creates an object that represent android theme's default background for borderless selectable elements (`?android:attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless`). Available on android API level 21+. `rippleRadius` parameter controls the radius of the ripple effect.

---

#### `Ripple()`

```
static Ripple(
  color: ColorValue,
  borderless: boolean,
  rippleRadius?: number | null,
): RippleBackgroundPropType;
```

Creates an object that represents ripple drawable with specified color (as a string). If property `borderless` evaluates to true the ripple will render outside of the view bounds (see native actionbar buttons as an example of that behavior). This background type is available on Android API level 21+.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| color | string | Yes | The ripple color |
| borderless | boolean | Yes | If the ripple can render outside its bounds |
| rippleRadius | ?number | No | controls the radius of the ripple effect |

#### `canUseNativeForeground()`

```
static canUseNativeForeground(): boolean;
```

## InputAccessoryView

A component which enables customization of the keyboard input accessory view on iOS. The input accessory view is displayed above the keyboard whenever a `TextInput` has focus. This component can be used to create custom toolbars.

To use this component wrap your custom toolbar with the InputAccessoryView component, and set a `nativeID`. Then, pass that `nativeID` as the `inputAccessoryViewID` of whatever `TextInput` you desire. A basic example:

This component can also be used to create sticky text inputs (text inputs which are anchored to the top of the keyboard). To do this, wrap a `TextInput` with the `InputAccessoryView` component, and don't set a `nativeID`. For an example, look at InputAccessoryViewExample.js.

## SafeAreaView

The purpose of `SafeAreaView` is to render content within the safe area boundaries of a device. It is currently only applicable to iOS devices with iOS version 11 or later.

`SafeAreaView` renders nested content and automatically applies padding to reflect the portion of the view that is not covered by navigation bars, tab bars, toolbars, and other ancestor views. Moreover, and most importantly, Safe Area's paddings reflect the physical limitation of the screen, such as rounded corners or camera notches (i.e. the sensor housing area on iPhone 13).

### Example

To use, wrap your top level view with a `SafeAreaView` with a `flex: 1` style applied to it. You may also want to use a background color that matches your application's design.

---

### Reference

### Props

#### View Props

Inherits View Props.

> As padding is used to implement the behavior of the component, padding rules in styles applied to a `SafeAreaView` will be ignored and can cause different results depending on the platform. See #22211 for details.

## Image Style Props

### Examples

#### Image Border

#### Image Border Radius

#### Image Tint

### Reference

### Props

#### `backfaceVisibility`

The property defines whether or not the back face of a rotated image should be visible.

| Type                          | Default     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| enum(`'visible'`, `'hidden'`) | `'visible'` |

| number |

---

#### `borderTopRightRadius`

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `borderWidth`

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `opacity`

Set an opacity value for the image. The number should be in the range from `0.0` to `1.0`.

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| number | `1.0`   |

---

#### `overflow`

| Type                          | Default     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| enum(`'visible'`, `'hidden'`) | `'visible'` |

---

#### `overlayColor`Android

When the image has rounded corners, specifying an overlayColor will cause the remaining space in the corners to be filled with a solid color. This is useful in cases which are not supported by the Android implementation of rounded corners:

- Certain resize modes, such as `'contain'`
- Animated GIFs

A typical way to use this prop is with images displayed on a solid background and setting the `overlayColor` to the same color as the background.

For details of how this works under the hood, see Fresco documentation.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

#### `resizeMode`

Determines how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw image dimensions. Defaults to `cover`.

- `cover`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that:

  - Both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding)
  - At least one dimension of the scaled image will be equal to the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding)

- `contain`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).

- `stretch`: Scale width and height independently, This may change the aspect ratio of the src.

- `repeat`: Repeat the image to cover the frame of the view. The image will keep its size and aspect ratio, unless it is larger than the view, in which case it will be scaled down uniformly so that it is contained in the view.

- `center`: Center the image in the view along both dimensions. If the image is larger than the view, scale it down uniformly so that it is contained in the view.

| Type | Default |
| --- | --- |
| enum(`'cover'`, `'contain'`, `'stretch'`, `'repeat'`, `'center'`) | `'cover'` |

---

#### `objectFit`

Determines how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw image dimensions.

| Type                                                   | Default   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| enum(`'cover'`, `'contain'`, `'fill'`, `'scale-down'`) | `'cover'` |

---

#### `tintColor`

Changes the color of all the non-transparent pixels to the tintColor.

## Shadow Props

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

---

### Reference

There are 3 sets of shadow APIs in React Native:

- `boxShadow`: A View style prop and a spec-compliant implementation of the web style prop of the same name.
- `dropShadow`: A specific filter function available as part of the `filter` View style prop.
- Various `shadow` props (`shadowColor`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowOpacity`, `shadowRadius`): These map directly to their native counterparts exposed by the platform-level APIs.

The difference between `dropShadow` and `boxShadow` are as follows:

- `dropShadow` exists as part of `filter`, whereas `boxShadow` is a standalone style prop.
- `dropShadow` is an alpha mask, so only pixels with a positive alpha value will "cast" a shadow. `boxShadow` will cast around the border box of the element no matter it's contents (unless it is inset).
- `dropShadow` is only available on Android, `boxShadow` is available on iOS and Android.
- `dropShadow` cannot be inset like `boxShadow`.
- `dropShadow` does not have the `spreadDistance` argument like `boxShadow`.

Both `boxShadow` and `dropShadow` are generally more capable than the `shadow` props. The `shadow` props, however, map to native platform-level APIs, so if you only need a straightforward shadow these props are recommended. Note that only `shadowColor` works on both Android and iOS, all other `shadow` props only work on iOS.

### Props

#### `boxShadow`

See View Style Props for documentation.

#### `dropShadow`Android

See View Style Props for documentation.

#### `shadowColor`

Sets the drop shadow color.

This property will only work on Android API 28 and above. For similar functionality on lower Android APIs, use the `elevation` property.

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `shadowOffset`iOS

Sets the drop shadow offset.

| Type                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| object: `{width: number,height: number}` |

---

#### `shadowOpacity`iOS

Sets the drop shadow opacity (multiplied by the color's alpha component).

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `shadowRadius`iOS

Sets the drop shadow blur radius.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

## Networking

Many mobile apps need to load resources from a remote URL. You may want to make a POST request to a REST API, or you may need to fetch a chunk of static content from another server.

### Using Fetch

React Native provides the Fetch API for your networking needs. Fetch will seem familiar if you have used `XMLHttpRequest` or other networking APIs before. You may refer to MDN's guide on Using Fetch for additional information.

#### Making requests

In order to fetch content from an arbitrary URL, you can pass the URL to fetch:

```
fetch('https://mywebsite.com/mydata.json');
```

Fetch also takes an optional second argument that allows you to customize the HTTP request. You may want to specify additional headers, or make a POST request:

```
fetch('https://mywebsite.com/endpoint/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Accept: 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    firstParam: 'yourValue',
    secondParam: 'yourOtherValue',
  }),
});
```

Take a look at the Fetch Request docs for a full list of properties.

#### Handling the response

The above examples show how you can make a request. In many cases, you will want to do something with the response.

Networking is an inherently asynchronous operation. Fetch method will return a Promise that makes it straightforward to write code that works in an asynchronous manner:

```
const getMoviesFromApi = () => {
  return fetch('https://reactnative.dev/movies.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(json => {
      return json.movies;
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
};
```

You can also use the `async` / `await` syntax in a React Native app:

```
const getMoviesFromApiAsync = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      'https://reactnative.dev/movies.json',
    );
    const json = await response.json();
    return json.movies;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

Don't forget to catch any errors that may be thrown by `fetch`, otherwise they will be dropped silently.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

> By default, iOS 9.0 or later enforce App Transport Security (ATS). ATS requires any HTTP connection to use HTTPS. If you need to fetch from a cleartext URL (one that begins with `http`) you will first need to add an ATS exception. If you know ahead of time what domains you will need access to, it is more secure to add exceptions only for those domains; if the domains are not known until runtime you can disable ATS completely. Note however that from January 2017, Apple's App Store review will require reasonable justification for disabling ATS. See Apple's documentation for more information.

> On Android, as of API Level 28, clear text traffic is also blocked by default. This behaviour can be overridden by setting `android:usesCleartextTraffic` in the app manifest file.

### Using Other Networking Libraries

The XMLHttpRequest API is built into React Native. This means that you can use third party libraries such as frisbee or axios that depend on it, or you can use the XMLHttpRequest API directly if you prefer.

```
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.onreadystatechange = e => {
  if (request.readyState !== 4) {
    return;
  }

  if (request.status === 200) {
    console.log('success', request.responseText);
  } else {
    console.warn('error');
  }
};

request.open('GET', 'https://mywebsite.com/endpoint/');
request.send();
```

> The security model for XMLHttpRequest is different than on web as there is no concept of CORS in native apps.

### WebSocket Support

React Native also supports WebSockets, a protocol which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

```
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://host.com/path');

ws.onopen = () => {
  // connection opened
  ws.send('something'); // send a message
};

ws.onmessage = e => {
  // a message was received
  console.log(e.data);
};

ws.onerror = e => {
  // an error occurred
  console.log(e.message);
};

ws.onclose = e => {
  // connection closed
  console.log(e.code, e.reason);
};
```

### Known Issues with `fetch` and cookie based authentication

The following options are currently not working with `fetch`

- `redirect:manual`
- `credentials:omit`

* Having same name headers on Android will result in only the latest one being present. A temporary solution can be found here: <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/18837#issuecomment-398779994>.
* Cookie based authentication is currently unstable. You can view some of the issues raised here: <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23185>
* As a minimum on iOS, when redirected through a `302`, if a `Set-Cookie` header is present, the cookie is not set properly. Since the redirect cannot be handled manually this might cause a scenario where infinite requests occur if the redirect is the result of an expired session.

### Configuring NSURLSession on iOS

For some applications it may be appropriate to provide a custom `NSURLSessionConfiguration` for the underlying `NSURLSession` that is used for network requests in a React Native application running on iOS. For instance, one may need to set a custom user agent string for all network requests coming from the app or supply `NSURLSession` with an ephemeral `NSURLSessionConfiguration`. The function `RCTSetCustomNSURLSessionConfigurationProvider` allows for such customization. Remember to add the following import to the file in which `RCTSetCustomNSURLSessionConfigurationProvider` will be called:

objectivec

```
#import <React/RCTHTTPRequestHandler.h>
```

`RCTSetCustomNSURLSessionConfigurationProvider` should be called early in the application life cycle such that it is readily available when needed by React, for instance:

objectivec

```
-(void)application:(__unused UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

  // set RCTSetCustomNSURLSessionConfigurationProvider
  RCTSetCustomNSURLSessionConfigurationProvider(^NSURLSessionConfiguration *{
     NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];
     // configure the session
     return configuration;
  });

  // set up React
  _bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:self launchOptions:launchOptions];
}
```

#### `boxShadow`

note

`boxShadow` is only available on the New Architecture. Outset shadows are only supported on **Android 9+**. Inset shadows are only supported on **Android 10+**.

Adds a shadow effect to an element, with the ability to control the position, color, size, and blurriness of the shadow. This shadow either appears around the outside or inside of the border box of the element, depending on whether or not the shadow is _inset_. This is a spec-compliant implementation of the web style prop of the same name. Read more about all the arguments available in the BoxShadowValue documentation.

These shadows can be composed together so that a single `boxShadow` can be comprised of multiple different shadows.

`boxShadow` takes either a string which mimics the web syntax or an array of BoxShadowValue objects.

| Type                        |
| --------------------------- |
| enum(`'auto'`, `'pointer'`) |

---

#### `elevation`Android

Sets the elevation of a view, using Android's underlying elevation API. This adds a drop shadow to the item and affects z-order for overlapping views. Only supported on Android 5.0+, has no effect on earlier versions.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `filter`

note

Adds a graphical filter to the `View`. This filter is comprised of any number of _filter functions_, which each represent some atomic change to the graphical composition of the `View`. The complete list of valid filter functions is defined below. `filter` will apply to descendants of the `View` as well as the `View` itself. `filter` implies `overflow: hidden`, so descendants will be clipped to fit the bounds of the `View`.

The following filter functions work across all platforms:

- `brightness`: Changes the brightness of the `View`. Takes a non-negative number or percentage.
- `opacity`: Changes the opacity, or alpha, of the `View`. Takes a non-negative number or percentage.

note

Due to issues with performance and spec compliance, these are the only two filter functions available on iOS. There are plans to explore some potential workarounds using SwiftUI instead of UIKit for this implementation.

Android

The following filter functions work on Android only:

- `blur`: Blurs the `View` with a Guassian blur, where the specified length represents the radius used in the blurring algorithm. Any non-negative DIP value is valid (no percents). The larger the value, the blurrier the result.
- `contrast`: Changes the contrast of the `View`. Takes a non-negative number or percentage.
- `dropShadow`: Adds a shadow around the alpha mask of the `View` (only non-zero alpha pixels in the `View` will cast a shadow). Takes an optional color representing the shadow color, and 2 or 3 lengths. If 2 lengths are specified they are interperted as `offsetX` and `offsetY` which will translate the shadow in the X and Y dimensions respectfully. If a 3rd length is given it is interpreted as the standard deviation of the Guassian blur used on the shadow - so a larger value will blur the shadow more. Read more about the arguments in DropShadowValue.
- `grayscale`: Converts the `View` to grayscale by the specified amount. Takes a non-negative number or percentage, where `1` or `100%` represents complete grayscale.
- `hueRotate`: Changes the hue of the View. The argument of this function defines the angle of a color wheel around which the hue will be rotated, so e.g., `360deg` would have no effect. This angle can have either `deg` or `rad` units.
- `invert`: Inverts the colors in the `View`. Takes a non-negative number or percentage, where `1` or `100%` represents complete inversion.
- `sepia`: Converts the `View` to sepia. Takes a non-negative number or percentage, where `1` or `100%` represents complete sepia.
- `saturate`: Changes the saturation of the `View`. Takes a non-negative number or percentage.

note

`blur` and `dropShadow` are only supported on **Android 12+**

`filter` takes either an array of objects comprising of the above filter functions or a string which mimics the web syntax.

## Security

Security is often overlooked when building apps. It is true that it is impossible to build software that is completely impenetrable—we’ve yet to invent a completely impenetrable lock (bank vaults do, after all, still get broken into). However, the probability of falling victim to a malicious attack or being exposed for a security vulnerability is inversely proportional to the effort you’re willing to put in to protecting your application against any such eventuality. Although an ordinary padlock is pickable, it is still much harder to get past than a cabinet hook!

In this guide, you will learn about best practices for storing sensitive information, authentication, network security, and tools that will help you secure your app. This is not a preflight checklist—it is a catalogue of options, each of which will help further protect your app and users.

### Storing Sensitive Info

Never store sensitive API keys in your app code. Anything included in your code could be accessed in plain text by anyone inspecting the app bundle. Tools like react-native-dotenv and react-native-config are great for adding environment-specific variables like API endpoints, but they should not be confused with server-side environment variables, which can often contain secrets and API keys.

If you must have an API key or a secret to access some resource from your app, the most secure way to handle this would be to build an orchestration layer between your app and the resource. This could be a serverless function (e.g. using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions) which can forward the request with the required API key or secret. Secrets in server side code cannot be accessed by the API consumers the same way secrets in your app code can.

**For persisted user data, choose the right type of storage based on its sensitivity.** As your app is used, you’ll often find the need to save data on the device, whether to support your app being used offline, cut down on network requests or save your user’s access token between sessions so they wouldn’t have to re-authenticate each time they use the app.

> **Persisted vs unpersisted** — persisted data is written to the device’s disk, which lets the data be read by your app across application launches without having to do another network request to fetch it or asking the user to re-enter it. But this also can make that data more vulnerable to being accessed by attackers. Unpersisted data is never written to disk—so there's no data to access!

#### Async Storage

Async Storage is a community-maintained module for React Native that provides an asynchronous, unencrypted, key-value store. Async Storage is not shared between apps: every app has its own sandbox environment and has no access to data from other apps.

| **Do** use async storage when... | **Don't** use async storage for... |
| --- | --- |
| Persisting non-sensitive data across app runs | Token storage |
| Persisting Redux state | Secrets |
| Persisting GraphQL state |  |
| Storing global app-wide variables |  |

##### Developer Notes

- Web

> Async Storage is the React Native equivalent of Local Storage from the web

#### Secure Storage

React Native does not come bundled with any way of storing sensitive data. However, there are pre-existing solutions for Android and iOS platforms.

##### iOS - Keychain Services

Keychain Services allows you to securely store small chunks of sensitive info for the user. This is an ideal place to store certificates, tokens, passwords, and any other sensitive information that doesn’t belong in Async Storage.

##### Android - Secure Shared Preferences

Shared Preferences is the Android equivalent for a persistent key-value data store. **Data in Shared Preferences is not encrypted by default**, but Encrypted Shared Preferences wraps the Shared Preferences class for Android, and automatically encrypts keys and values.

##### Android - Keystore

The Android Keystore system lets you store cryptographic keys in a container to make it more difficult to extract from the device.

In order to use iOS Keychain services or Android Secure Shared Preferences, you can either write a bridge yourself or use a library which wraps them for you and provides a unified API at your own risk. Some libraries to consider:

-
-

> **Be mindful of unintentionally storing or exposing sensitive info.** This could happen accidentally, for example saving sensitive form data in redux state and persisting the whole state tree in Async Storage. Or sending user tokens and personal info to an application monitoring service such as Sentry or Crashlytics.

### Authentication and Deep Linking

Mobile apps have a unique vulnerability that is non-existent in the web: **deep linking**. Deep linking is a way of sending data directly to a native application from an outside source. A deep link looks like `app://` where `app` is your app scheme and anything following the // could be used internally to handle the request.

For example, if you were building an ecommerce app, you could use `app://products/1` to deep link to your app and open the product detail page for a product with id 1. You can think of these kind of like URLs on the web, but with one crucial distinction:

Deep links are not secure and you should never send any sensitive information in them.

The reason deep links are not secure is because there is no centralized method of registering URL schemes. As an application developer, you can use almost any url scheme you choose by configuring it in Xcode for iOS or adding an intent on Android.

There is nothing stopping a malicious application from hijacking your deep link by also registering to the same scheme and then obtaining access to the data your link contains. Sending something like `app://products/1` is not harmful, but sending tokens is a security concern.

When the operating system has two or more applications to choose from when opening a link, Android will show the user a Disambiguation dialog and ask them to choose which application to use to open the link. On iOS however, the operating system will make the choice for you, so the user will be blissfully unaware. Apple has made steps to address this issue in later iOS versions (iOS 11) where they instituted a first-come-first-served principle, although this vulnerability could still be exploited in different ways which you can read more about here. Using universal links will allow linking to content within your app securely in iOS.

#### OAuth2 and Redirects

The OAuth2 authentication protocol is incredibly popular nowadays, prided as the most complete and secure protocol around. The OpenID Connect protocol is also based on this. In OAuth2, the user is asked to authenticate via a third party. On successful completion, this third party redirects back to the requesting application with a verification code which can be exchanged for a JWT — a JSON Web Token. JWT is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties on the web.

On the web, this redirect step is secure, because URLs on the web are guaranteed to be unique. This is not true for apps because, as mentioned earlier, there is no centralized method of registering URL schemes! In order to address this security concern, an additional check must be added in the form of PKCE.

PKCE, pronounced “Pixy” stands for Proof of Key Code Exchange, and is an extension to the OAuth 2 spec. This involves adding an additional layer of security which verifies that the authentication and token exchange requests come from the same client. PKCE uses the SHA 256 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm. SHA 256 creates a unique “signature” for a text or file of any size, but it is:

- Always the same length regardless of the input file
- Guaranteed to always produce the same result for the same input
- One way (that is, you can’t reverse engineer it to reveal the original input)

Now you have two values:

- **code_verifier** - a large random string generated by the client
- **code_challenge** - the SHA 256 of the code_verifier

During the initial `/authorize` request, the client also sends the `code_challenge` for the `code_verifier` it keeps in memory. After the authorize request has returned correctly, the client also sends the `code_verifier` that was used to generate the `code_challenge`. The IDP will then calculate the `code_challenge`, see if it matches what was set on the very first `/authorize` request, and only send the access token if the values match.

This guarantees that only the application that triggered the initial authorization flow would be able to successfully exchange the verification code for a JWT. So even if a malicious application gets access to the verification code, it will be useless on its own. To see this in action, check out this example.

A library to consider for native OAuth is react-native-app-auth. React-native-app-auth is an SDK for communicating with OAuth2 providers. It wraps the native AppAuth-iOS and AppAuth-Android libraries and can support PKCE.

> React-native-app-auth can support PKCE only if your Identity Provider supports it.

### Network Security

Your APIs should always use SSL encryption. SSL encryption protects against the requested data being read in plain text between when it leaves the server and before it reaches the client. You’ll know the endpoint is secure, because it starts with `https://` instead of `http://`.

#### SSL Pinning

Using https endpoints could still leave your data vulnerable to interception. With https, the client will only trust the server if it can provide a valid certificate that is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority that is pre-installed on the client. An attacker could take advantage of this by installing a malicious root CA certificate to the user’s device, so the client would trust all certificates that are signed by the attacker. Thus, relying on certificates alone could still leave you vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.

**SSL pinning** is a technique that can be used on the client side to avoid this attack. It works by embedding (or pinning) a list of trusted certificates to the client during development, so that only the requests signed with one of the trusted certificates will be accepted, and any self-signed certificates will not be.

> When using SSL pinning, you should be mindful of certificate expiry. Certificates expire every 1-2 years and when one does, it’ll need to be updated in the app as well as on the server. As soon as the certificate on the server has been updated, any apps with the old certificate embedded in them will cease to work.

### Summary

There is no bulletproof way to handle security, but with conscious effort and diligence, it is possible to significantly reduce the likelihood of a security breach in your application. Invest in security proportional to the sensitivity of the data stored in your application, the number of users, and the damage a hacker could do when gaining access to their account. And remember: it’s significantly harder to access information that was never requested in the first place.

## Accessibility

Both Android and iOS provide APIs for integrating apps with assistive technologies like the bundled screen readers VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android). React Native has complementary APIs that let your app accommodate all users.

info

Android and iOS differ slightly in their approaches, and thus the React Native implementations may vary by platform.

### Accessibility properties

#### `accessible`

When `true`, indicates that the view is an accessibility element. When a view is an accessibility element, it groups its children into a single selectable component. By default, all touchable elements are accessible.

On Android, `accessible={true}` property for a react-native View will be translated into native `focusable={true}`.

```
<View accessible={true}>
  <Text>text one</Text>
  <Text>text two</Text>
</View>
```

In the above example, accessibility focus is only available on the parent view with the `accessible` property, and not individually for 'text one' and 'text two'.

#### `accessibilityLabel`

When a view is marked as accessible, it is a good practice to set an `accessibilityLabel` on the view, so that people who use VoiceOver or TalkBack know what element they have selected. A screen reader will verbalize this string when the associated element is selected.

To use, set the `accessibilityLabel` property to a custom string on your View, Text, or Touchable:

```
<TouchableOpacity
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel="Tap me!"
  onPress={onPress}>
  <View style={styles.button}>
    <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Press me!</Text>
  </View>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

In the above example, the `accessibilityLabel` on the TouchableOpacity element would default to "Press me!". The label is constructed by concatenating all Text node children separated by spaces.

#### `accessibilityLabelledBy`Android

A reference to another element nativeID used to build complex forms. The value of `accessibilityLabelledBy` should match the `nativeID` of the related element:

```
<View>
  <Text nativeID="formLabel">Label for Input Field</Text>
  <TextInput
    accessibilityLabel="input"
    accessibilityLabelledBy="formLabel"
  />
</View>
```

In the above example, the screen reader announces `Input, Edit Box for Label for Input Field` when focusing on the TextInput.

#### `accessibilityHint`

An accessibility hint can be used to provide additional context to the user on the result of the action when it is not clear from the accessibility label alone.

Provide the `accessibilityHint` property a custom string on your View, Text, or Touchable:

```
<TouchableOpacity
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel="Go back"
  accessibilityHint="Navigates to the previous screen"
  onPress={onPress}>
  <View style={styles.button}>
    <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Back</Text>
  </View>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

iOS

In the above example, VoiceOver will read the hint after the label, if the user has hints enabled in the device's VoiceOver settings. Read more about guidelines for `accessibilityHint` in the iOS Developer Docs

Android

In the above example, TalkBack will read the hint after the label. At this time, hints cannot be turned off on Android.

#### `accessibilityLanguage`iOS

By using the `accessibilityLanguage` property, the screen reader will understand which language to use while reading the element's **label**, **value**, and **hint**. The provided string value must follow the BCP 47 specification.

```
<View
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel="Pizza"
  accessibilityLanguage="it-IT">
  <Text>🍕</Text>
</View>
```

#### `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`iOS

Inverting screen colors is an accessibility feature available in iOS and iPadOS for people with color blindness, low vision, or vision impairment. If there's a view you don't want to invert when this setting is on, possibly a photo, set this property to `true`.

#### `accessibilityLiveRegion`Android

When components dynamically change, we want TalkBack to alert the end user. This is made possible by the `accessibilityLiveRegion` property. It can be set to `none`, `polite`, and `assertive`:

- **none** Accessibility services should not announce changes to this view.
- **polite** Accessibility services should announce changes to this view.
- **assertive** Accessibility services should interrupt ongoing speech to immediately announce changes to this view.

```
<TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={addOne}>
  <View style={styles.embedded}>
    <Text>Click me</Text>
  </View>
</TouchableWithoutFeedback>
<Text accessibilityLiveRegion="polite">
  Clicked {count} times
</Text>
```

In the above example method `addOne` changes the state variable `count`. When the TouchableWithoutFeedback is triggered, TalkBack reads the text in the Text view because of its `accessibilityLiveRegion="polite"` property.

#### `accessibilityRole`

`accessibilityRole` communicates the purpose of a component to the user of assistive technology.

`accessibilityRole` can be one of the following:

- **adjustable** Used when an element can be "adjusted" (e.g. a slider).
- **alert** Used when an element contains important text to be presented to the user.
- **button** Used when the element should be treated as a button.
- **checkbox** Used when an element represents a checkbox that can be checked, unchecked, or have a mixed checked state.
- **combobox** Used when an element represents a combo box, which allows the user to select among several choices.
- **header** Used when an element acts as a header for a content section (e.g. the title of a navigation bar).
- **image** Used when the element should be treated as an image. Can be combined with a button or link.
- **imagebutton** Used when the element should be treated as a button and is also an image.
- **keyboardkey** Used when the element acts as a keyboard key.
- **link** Used when the element should be treated as a link.
- **menu** Used when the component is a menu of choices.
- **menubar** Used when a component is a container of multiple menus.
- **menuitem** Used to represent an item within a menu.
- **none** Used when the element has no role.
- **progressbar** Used to represent a component that indicates the progress of a task.
- **radio** Used to represent a radio button.
- **radiogroup** Used to represent a group of radio buttons.
- **scrollbar** Used to represent a scroll bar.
- **search** Used when a text field element should also be treated as a search field.
- **spinbutton** Used to represent a button that opens a list of choices.
- **summary** Used when an element can be used to provide a quick summary of current conditions in the app when the app first launches.
- **switch** Used to represent a switch that can be turned on and off.
- **tab** Used to represent a tab.
- **tablist** Used to represent a list of tabs.
- **text** Used when the element should be treated as static text that cannot change.
- **timer** Used to represent a timer.
- **togglebutton** Used to represent a toggle button. Should be used with accessibilityState checked to indicate if the button is toggled on or off.
- **toolbar** Used to represent a toolbar (a container of action buttons or components).
- **grid** Used with ScrollView, VirtualizedList, FlatList, or SectionList to represent a grid. Adds the in/out of grid announcements to Android's GridView.

#### `accessibilityShowsLargeContentViewer`iOS

A boolean value that determines whether the large content viewer is shown when the user performs a long press on the element.

Available in iOS 13.0 and later.

#### `accessibilityLargeContentTitle`iOS

A string that will be used as the title of the large content viewer when it is shown.

Requires `accessibilityShowsLargeContentViewer` to be set to `true`.

```
<View
  accessibilityShowsLargeContentViewer={true}
  accessibilityLargeContentTitle="Home Tab">
  <Text>Home</Text>
</View>
```

#### `accessibilityState`

Describes the current state of a component to the assistive technology user.

`accessibilityState` is an object. It contains the following fields:

| Name | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| disabled | Indicates whether the element is disabled or not. | boolean | No |
| selected | Indicates whether a selectable element is currently selected or not. | boolean | No |
| checked | Indicates the state of a checkable element. This field can either take a boolean or the "mixed" string to represent mixed checkboxes. | boolean or 'mixed' | No |
| busy | Indicates whether an element is currently busy or not. | boolean | No |
| expanded | Indicates whether an expandable element is currently expanded or collapsed. | boolean | No |

To use, set the `accessibilityState` to an object with a specific definition.

#### `accessibilityValue`

Represents the current value of a component. It can be a textual description of a component's value, or for range-based components, such as sliders and progress bars, it contains range information (minimum, current, and maximum).

`accessibilityValue` is an object. It contains the following fields:

| Name | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| min | The minimum value of this component's range. | integer | Required if `now` is set. |
| max | The maximum value of this component's range. | integer | Required if `now` is set. |
| now | The current value of this component's range. | integer | No |
| text | A textual description of this component's value. Will override `min`, `now`, and `max` if set. | string | No |

#### `accessibilityViewIsModal`iOS

A boolean value that indicates whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.

For example, in a window that contains sibling views `A` and `B`, setting `accessibilityViewIsModal` to `true` on view `B` causes VoiceOver to ignore the elements in view `A`. On the other hand, if view `B` contains a child view `C` and you set `accessibilityViewIsModal` to `true` on view `C`, VoiceOver does not ignore the elements in view `A`.

#### `accessibilityElementsHidden`iOS

A boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element are hidden.

For example, in a window that contains sibling views `A` and `B`, setting `accessibilityElementsHidden` to `true` on view `B` causes VoiceOver to ignore the elements in view `B`. This is similar to the Android property `importantForAccessibility="no-hide-descendants"`.

#### `aria-valuemax`

Represents the maximum value for range-based components, such as sliders and progress bars.

#### `aria-valuemin`

Represents the minimum value for range-based components, such as sliders and progress bars.

#### `aria-valuenow`

Represents the current value for range-based components, such as sliders and progress bars.

#### `aria-valuetext`

Represents the textual description of the component.

#### `aria-busy`

Indicates an element is being modified and that assistive technologies may want to wait until the changes are complete before informing the user about the update.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |

#### `aria-checked`

Indicates the state of a checkable element. This field can either take a boolean or the "mixed" string to represent mixed checkboxes.

| Type             | Default |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| boolean, 'mixed' | false   |

#### `aria-disabled`

Indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |

#### `aria-expanded`

Indicates whether an expandable element is currently expanded or collapsed.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |

#### `aria-hidden`

Indicates whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element are hidden.

For example, in a window that contains sibling views `A` and `B`, setting `aria-hidden` to `true` on view `B` causes VoiceOver to ignore the elements in view `B`.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |

#### `aria-label`

Defines a string value that labels an interactive element.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

#### `aria-labelledby`Android

Identifies the element that labels the element it is applied to. The value of `aria-labelledby` should match the `nativeID` of the related element:

```
<View>
  <Text nativeID="formLabel">Label for Input Field</Text>
  <TextInput aria-label="input" aria-labelledby="formLabel" />
</View>
```

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

#### `aria-live`Android

Indicates that an element will be updated and describes the types of updates the user agents, assistive technologies, and user can expect from the live region.

- **off** Accessibility services should not announce changes to this view.
- **polite** Accessibility services should announce changes to this view.
- **assertive** Accessibility services should interrupt ongoing speech to immediately announce changes to this view.

| Type                                     | Default |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| enum(`'assertive'`, `'off'`, `'polite'`) | `'off'` |

---

#### `aria-modal`iOS

Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | false   |

#### `aria-selected`

Indicates whether a selectable element is currently selected or not.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

#### `importantForAccessibility`Android

In the case of two overlapping UI components with the same parent, default accessibility focus can have unpredictable behavior. The `importantForAccessibility` property will resolve this by controlling if a view fires accessibility events and if it is reported to accessibility services. It can be set to `auto`, `yes`, `no` and `no-hide-descendants` (the last value will force accessibility services to ignore the component and all of its children).

```
<View style={styles.container}>
  <View
    style={[styles.layout, {backgroundColor: 'green'}]}
    importantForAccessibility="yes">
    <Text>First layout</Text>
  </View>
  <View
    style={[styles.layout, {backgroundColor: 'yellow'}]}
    importantForAccessibility="no-hide-descendants">
    <Text>Second layout</Text>
  </View>
</View>
```

In the above example, the `yellow` layout and its descendants are completely invisible to TalkBack and all other accessibility services. So we can use overlapping views with the same parent without confusing TalkBack.

#### `onAccessibilityEscape`iOS

Assign this property to a custom function which will be called when someone performs the "escape" gesture, which is a two finger Z shaped gesture. An escape function should move back hierarchically in the user interface. This can mean moving up or back in a navigation hierarchy or dismissing a modal user interface. If the selected element does not have an `onAccessibilityEscape` function, the system will attempt to traverse up the view hierarchy until it finds a view that does or bonk to indicate it was unable to find one.

#### `onAccessibilityTap`iOS

Use this property to assign a custom function to be called when someone activates an accessible element by double tapping on it while it's selected.

#### `onMagicTap`iOS

Assign this property to a custom function which will be called when someone performs the "magic tap" gesture, which is a double-tap with two fingers. A magic tap function should perform the most relevant action a user could take on a component. In the Phone app on iPhone, a magic tap answers a phone call or ends the current one. If the selected element does not have an `onMagicTap` function, the system will traverse up the view hierarchy until it finds a view that does.

#### `role`

`role` communicates the purpose of a component and has precedence over the `accessibilityRole` prop.

`role` can be one of the following:

- **alert** Used when an element contains important text to be presented to the user.
- **button** Used when the element should be treated as a button.
- **checkbox** Used when an element represents a checkbox that can be checked, unchecked, or have a mixed checked state.
- **combobox** Used when an element represents a combo box, which allows the user to select among several choices.
- **grid** Used with ScrollView, VirtualizedList, FlatList, or SectionList to represent a grid. Adds the in/out of grid announcements to the android GridView.
- **heading** Used when an element acts as a header for a content section (e.g. the title of a navigation bar).
- **img** Used when the element should be treated as an image. Can be combined with a button or link, for example.
- **link** Used when the element should be treated as a link.
- **list** Used to identify a list of items.
- **listitem** Used to itentify an item in a list.
- **menu** Used when the component is a menu of choices.
- **menubar** Used when a component is a container of multiple menus.
- **menuitem** Used to represent an item within a menu.
- **none** Used when the element has no role.
- **presentation** Used when the element has no role.
- **progressbar** Used to represent a component that indicates the progress of a task.
- **radio** Used to represent a radio button.
- **radiogroup** Used to represent a group of radio buttons.
- **scrollbar** Used to represent a scroll bar.
- **searchbox** Used when the text field element should also be treated as a search field.
- **slider** Used when an element can be "adjusted" (e.g. a slider).
- **spinbutton** Used to represent a button that opens a list of choices.
- **summary** Used when an element can be used to provide a quick summary of current conditions in the app when the app first launches.
- **switch** Used to represent a switch that can be turned on and off.
- **tab** Used to represent a tab.
- **tablist** Used to represent a list of tabs.
- **timer** Used to represent a timer.
- **toolbar** Used to represent a toolbar (a container of action buttons or components).

### Accessibility Actions

Accessibility actions allow assistive technology to programmatically invoke the action(s) of a component. To support accessibility actions, a component must do two things:

- Define the list of actions it supports via the `accessibilityActions` property.
- Implement an `onAccessibilityAction` function to handle action requests.

The `accessibilityActions` property should contain a list of action objects. Each action object should contain the following fields:

| Name  | Type   | Required |
| ----- | ------ | -------- |
| name  | string | Yes      |
| label | string | No       |

Actions either represent standard actions, such as clicking a button or adjusting a slider, or custom actions specific to a given component such as deleting an email message. The `name` field is required for both standard and custom actions, but `label` is optional for standard actions.

When adding support for standard actions, `name` must be one of the following:

- `'magicTap'` - iOS only - While VoiceOver focus is on or inside the component, the user double tapped with two fingers.
- `'escape'` - iOS only - While VoiceOver focus is on or inside the component, the user performed a two-finger scrub gesture (left, right, left).
- `'activate'` - Activate the component. This should perform the same action with, or without, assistive technology. Engaged when a screen reader user double taps the component.
- `'increment'` - Increment an adjustable component. On iOS, VoiceOver generates this action when the component has a role of `'adjustable'` and the user places focus on it and swipes upward. On Android, TalkBack generates this action when the user places accessibility focus on the component and presses the volume-up button.
- `'decrement'` - Decrement an adjustable component. On iOS, VoiceOver generates this action when the component has a role of `'adjustable'` and the user places focus on it and swipes downward. On Android, TalkBack generates this action when the user places accessibility focus on the component and presses the volume-down button.
- `'longpress'` - Android only - This action is generated when the user places accessibility focus on the component, then double-taps and holds one finger on the screen. This should perform the same action with, or without, assistive technology.

The `label` field is optional for standard actions and is often unused by assistive technologies. For custom actions, it is a localized string containing a description of the action to be presented to the user.

To handle action requests, a component must implement an `onAccessibilityAction` function. The only argument to this function is an event containing the name of the action to perform. The below example from RNTester shows how to create a component that defines and handles several custom actions.

```
<View
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityActions={[
    {name: 'cut', label: 'cut'},
    {name: 'copy', label: 'copy'},
    {name: 'paste', label: 'paste'},
  ]}
  onAccessibilityAction={event => {
    switch (event.nativeEvent.actionName) {
      case 'cut':
        Alert.alert('Alert', 'cut action success');
        break;
      case 'copy':
        Alert.alert('Alert', 'copy action success');
        break;
      case 'paste':
        Alert.alert('Alert', 'paste action success');
        break;
    }
  }}
/>
```

### Checking if a Screen Reader is Enabled

The `AccessibilityInfo` API allows you to determine whether or not a screen reader is currently active. See the AccessibilityInfo documentation for details.

### Sending Accessibility EventsAndroid

Sometimes it is useful to trigger an accessibility event on a UI component (i.e. when a custom view appears on a screen or set accessibility focus to a view). Native UIManager module exposes a method ‘sendAccessibilityEvent’ for this purpose. It takes two arguments: a view tag and a type of event. The supported event types are `typeWindowStateChanged`, `typeViewFocused`, and `typeViewClicked`.

```
import {Platform, UIManager, findNodeHandle} from 'react-native';

if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
  UIManager.sendAccessibilityEvent(
    findNodeHandle(this),
    UIManager.AccessibilityEventTypes.typeViewFocused,
  );
}
```

### Testing TalkBack SupportAndroid

To enable TalkBack, go to the Settings app on your Android device or emulator. Tap Accessibility, then TalkBack. Toggle the "Use service" switch to enable or disable it.

Android emulators don't have TalkBack installed by default. You can install TalkBack on your emulator via the Google Play Store. Make sure to choose an emulator with the Google Play store installed. These are available in Android Studio.

You can use the volume key shortcut to toggle TalkBack. To turn on the volume key shortcut, go to the Settings app, then Accessibility. At the top, turn on the volume key shortcut.

To use the volume key shortcut, press both volume keys for 3 seconds to start an accessibility tool.

Additionally, if you prefer, you can toggle TalkBack via the command line with:

shell

```
# disable
adb shell settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services com.android.talkback/com.google.android.marvin.talkback.TalkBackService

# enable
adb shell settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services com.google.android.marvin.talkback/com.google.android.marvin.talkback.TalkBackService
```

### Testing VoiceOver SupportiOS

To enable VoiceOver on your iOS or iPadOS device, go to the Settings app, tap General, then Accessibility. There you will find many tools available for people to enable their devices to be more usable, including VoiceOver. To enable VoiceOver, tap on VoiceOver under "Vision" and toggle the switch that appears at the top.

At the very bottom of the Accessibility settings, there is an "Accessibility Shortcut". You can use this to toggle VoiceOver by triple-clicking the Home button.

VoiceOver isn't available via the simulator, but you can use Accessibility Inspector from Xcode to use the macOS VoiceOver through an application. Note it's always best to test with a device as macOS's VoiceOver may result in varied experiences.

If you have constraints that are not served well by a Framework, or you prefer to write your own Framework, you can create a React Native app without using a Framework.

To do so, you'll first need to set up your environment. Once you're set up, continue with the steps below to create an application and start developing.

## Step 1: Creating a new application

> If you previously installed a global `react-native-cli` package, please remove it as it may cause unexpected issues:
>
> shell
>
> ```
> npm uninstall -g react-native-cli @react-native-community/cli
> ```

You can use React Native Community CLI to generate a new project. Let's create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

shell

```
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init AwesomeProject
```

This is not necessary if you are integrating React Native into an existing application, or if you've installed Expo in your project, or if you're adding Android support to an existing React Native project (see Integration with Existing Apps). You can also use a third-party CLI to set up your React Native app, such as Ignite CLI.

info

If you are having trouble with iOS, try to reinstall the dependencies by running:

1. `cd ios` to navigate to the `ios` folder.
2. `bundle install` to install Bundler
3. `bundle exec pod install` to install the iOS dependencies managed by CocoaPods.

##### \[Optional] Using a specific version or template

If you want to start a new project with a specific React Native version, you can use the `--version` argument:

shell

```
npx @react-native-community/cli@X.XX.X init AwesomeProject --version X.XX.X
```

You can also start a project with a custom React Native template with the `--template` argument, read more here.

#### Step 2: Start Metro

**Metro** is the JavaScript build tool for React Native. To start the Metro development server, run the following from your project folder:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm start
```

shell

```
yarn start
```

note

If you're familiar with web development, Metro is similar to bundlers such as Vite and webpack, but is designed end-to-end for React Native. For instance, Metro uses Babel to transform syntax such as JSX into executable JavaScript.

#### Step 3: Start your application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder. Run the following:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run android
```

shell

```
yarn android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android emulator shortly.

This is one way to run your app - you can also run it directly from within Android Studio.

> If you can't get this to work, see the Troubleshooting page.

#### Step 4: Modifying your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

- Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
- Press the `R` key twice or select `Reload` from the Dev Menu (`Ctrl` + `M`) to see your changes!

#### That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first barebone React Native app.

#### Now what?

- If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the Integration guide.
- If you're curious to learn more about React Native, check out the Introduction to React Native.

## Troubleshooting

These are some common issues you may run into while setting up React Native. If you encounter something that is not listed here, try searching for the issue in GitHub.

#### Port already in use

The Metro bundler runs on port 8081. If another process is already using that port, you can either terminate that process, or change the port that the bundler uses.

##### Terminating a process on port 8081

Run the following command to find the id for the process that is listening on port 8081:

shell

```
sudo lsof -i :8081
```

Then run the following to terminate the process:

shell

```
kill -9 <PID>
```

On Windows you can find the process using port 8081 using Resource Monitor and stop it using Task Manager.

##### Using a port other than 8081

You can configure the bundler to use a port other than 8081 by using the `port` parameter, from the root of your project run:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm start -- --port=8088
```

shell

```
yarn start --port 8088
```

You will also need to update your applications to load the JavaScript bundle from the new port. If running on device from Xcode, you can do this by updating occurrences of `8081` to your chosen port in the `ios/__App_Name__.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file.

#### NPM locking error

If you encounter an error such as `npm WARN locking Error: EACCES` while using the React Native CLI, try running the following:

shell

```
sudo chown -R $USER ~/.npm
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules
```

#### Missing libraries for React

If you added React Native manually to your project, make sure you have included all the relevant dependencies that you are using, like `RCTText.xcodeproj`, `RCTImage.xcodeproj`. Next, the binaries built by these dependencies have to be linked to your app binary. Use the `Linked Frameworks and Binaries` section in the Xcode project settings. More detailed steps are here: Linking Libraries.

If you are using CocoaPods, verify that you have added React along with the subspecs to the `Podfile`. For example, if you were using the `<Text />`, `<Image />` and `fetch()` APIs, you would need to add these in your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [
  'RCTText',
  'RCTImage',
  'RCTNetwork',
  'RCTWebSocket',
]
```

Next, make sure you have run `pod install` and that a `Pods/` directory has been created in your project with React installed. CocoaPods will instruct you to use the generated `.xcworkspace` file henceforth to be able to use these installed dependencies.

##### React Native does not compile when being used as a CocoaPod

There is a CocoaPods plugin called cocoapods-fix-react-native which handles any potential post-fixing of the source code due to differences when using a dependency manager.

##### Argument list too long: recursive header expansion failed

In the project's build settings, `User Search Header Paths` and `Header Search Paths` are two configs that specify where Xcode should look for `#import` header files specified in the code. For Pods, CocoaPods uses a default array of specific folders to look in. Verify that this particular config is not overwritten, and that none of the folders configured are too large. If one of the folders is a large folder, Xcode will attempt to recursively search the entire directory and throw above error at some point.

To revert the `User Search Header Paths` and `Header Search Paths` build settings to their defaults set by CocoaPods - select the entry in the Build Settings panel, and hit delete. It will remove the custom override and return to the CocoaPod defaults.

#### No transports available

React Native implements a polyfill for WebSockets. These polyfills are initialized as part of the react-native module that you include in your application through `import React from 'react'`. If you load another module that requires WebSockets, such as Firebase, be sure to load/require it after react-native:

```
import React from 'react';
import Firebase from 'firebase';
```

### Shell Command Unresponsive Exception

If you encounter a ShellCommandUnresponsiveException exception such as:

```
Execution failed for task ':app:installDebug'.
  com.android.builder.testing.api.DeviceException: com.android.ddmlib.ShellCommandUnresponsiveException
```

Try downgrading your Gradle version to 1.2.3 in `android/build.gradle`.

### react-native init hangs

If you run into issues where running `npx react-native init` hangs in your system, try running it again in verbose mode and referring to #2797 for common causes:

shell

```
npx react-native init --verbose
```

When you're debugging a process or need to know a little more about the error being thrown, you may want to use the verbose option to output more logs and information to nail down your issue.

Run the following command in your project's root directory.

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run android -- --verbose
```

shell

```
yarn android --verbose
```

### Unable to start react-native package manager (on Linux)

#### Case 1: Error "code":"ENOSPC","errno":"ENOSPC"

Issue caused by the number of directories inotify (used by watchman on Linux) can monitor. To solve it, run this command in your terminal window

shell

```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=582222 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

#### Error: spawnSync ./gradlew EACCES

If you run into issue where executing `npm run android` or `yarn android` on macOS throws the above error, try to run `sudo chmod +x android/gradlew` command to make `gradlew` files into executable.

## Debugging Basics

note

Debugging features, such as the Dev Menu, LogBox, and React Native DevTools are disabled in release (production) builds.

### Opening the Dev Menu

React Native provides an in-app developer menu providing access to debugging features. You can access the Dev Menu by shaking your device or via keyboard shortcuts:

- iOS Simulator: `Ctrl` + `Cmd ⌘` + `Z` (or Device > Shake)
- Android emulators: `Cmd ⌘` + `M` (macOS) or `Ctrl` + `M` (Windows and Linux)

Alternative (Android): `adb shell input keyevent 82`.

### Opening DevTools

React Native DevTools is our built-in debugger for React Native. It allows you to inspect and understand how your JavaScript code is running, similar to a web browser.

To open DevTools, either:

- Select "Open DevTools" in the Dev Menu.
- Press `j` from the CLI (`npx react-native start`).

On first launch, DevTools will open to a welcome panel, along with an open console drawer where you can view logs and interact with the JavaScript runtime. From the top of the window, you can navigate to other panels, including the integrated React Components Inspector and Profiler.

React Native DevTools is powered by a dedicated debugging architecture built into React Native and uses a customized build of the Chrome DevTools frontend. This enables us to offer familiar, browser-aligned debugging features that are deeply integrated and built for end-to-end reliability.

Learn more in our React Native DevTools guide.

note

React Native DevTools is only available with the Hermes engine, and requires either Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge installed.

info

##### Flipper and alternative debugging tools

React Native DevTools replaces the previous Flipper, Experimental Debugger, and Hermes debugger (Chrome) frontends. If you are on an older version of React Native, please go to the docs for your version.

For apps using JavaScriptCore instead of Hermes, Direct JSC Debugging is still available (see Other Debugging Methods).

React Native DevTools is designed for debugging React app concerns, and not to replace native tools. If you want to inspect React Native’s underlying platform layers (for example, while developing a Native Module), please use the debugging tools available in Xcode and Android Studio (see Debugging Native Code).

Other useful links:

-

### LogBox

LogBox is an in-app tool that displays when warnings or errors are logged by your app.

#### Fatal Errors

When an unrecoverable error occurs, such as a JavaScript syntax error, LogBox will open with the location of the error. In this state, LogBox is not dismissable since your code cannot be executed. LogBox will automatically dismiss once the syntax error is fixed — either via Fast Refresh or after a manual reload.

#### Console Errors and Warnings

Console errors and warnings are displayed as on-screen notifications with a red or yellow badge.

- **Errors** will display with a notification count. Tap the notification to see an expanded view and to paginate through other logs.
- **Warnings** will display a notification banner without details, prompting you to open React Native DevTools.

When React Native DevTools is open, all errors except fatal errors will be hidden to LogBox. We recommend using the Console panel within React Native DevTools as a source of truth, due to various LogBox options which can hide or adjust the level of certain logs.

**💡 Ignoring logs**

LogBox can be configured via the `LogBox` API.

js

```
import {LogBox} from 'react-native';
```

##### Ignore all logs

LogBox notifications can be disabled using `LogBox.ignoreAllLogs()`. This can be useful in situations such as giving product demos.

js

```
LogBox.ignoreAllLogs();
```

##### Ignore specific logs

Notifications can be disabled on a per-log basis via `LogBox.ignoreLogs()`. This can be useful for noisy warnings or those that cannot be fixed, e.g. in a third-party dependency.

js

```
LogBox.ignoreLogs([
  // Exact message
  'Warning: componentWillReceiveProps has been renamed',

  // Substring or regex match
  /GraphQL error: .*/,
]);
```

note

LogBox will treat certain errors from React as warnings, which will mean they don't display as an in-app error notification. Advanced users can change this behaviour by customising LogBox's warning filter using `LogBoxData.setWarningFilter()`.

### Performance Monitor

On Android and iOS, an in-app performance overlay can be toggled during development by selecting **"Perf Monitor"** in the Dev Menu. Learn more about this feature here.

info

The Performance Monitor runs in-app and is a guide. We recommend investigating the native tooling under Android Studio and Xcode for accurate performance measurements.

## React Native DevTools

React Native DevTools is our modern debugging experience for React Native. Purpose-built from the ground up, it aims to be fundamentally more integrated, correct, and reliable than previous debugging methods.

React Native DevTools is designed for debugging React app concerns, and not to replace native tools. If you want to inspect React Native’s underlying platform layers (for example, while developing a Native Module), please use the debugging tools available in Android Studio and Xcode (see Debugging Native Code).

**💡 Compatibility** — released in 0.76

React Native DevTools supports all React Native apps running Hermes. It replaces the previous Flipper, Experimental Debugger, and Hermes debugger (Chrome) frontends.

It is not possible to set up React Native DevTools with any older versions of React Native.

- **Chrome Browser DevTools — unsupported**
  - Connecting to React Native via `chrome://inspect` is no longer supported. Features may not work correctly, as the latest versions of Chrome DevTools (which are built to match the latest browser capabilities and APIs) have not been tested, and this frontend lacks our customisations. Instead, we ship a supported version with React Native DevTools.
- **Visual Studio Code — unsupported** (pre-existing)
  - Third party extensions such as Expo Tools and Radon IDE may have improved compatibility, but are not directly supported by the React team.

**💡 Feedback & FAQs**

We want the tooling you use to debug React across all platforms to be reliable, familiar, simple, and cohesive. All the features described on this page are built with these principles in mind, and we also want to offer more capabilities in future.

We are actively iterating on the future of React Native DevTools, and have created a centralized GitHub discussion to keep track of issues, frequently asked questions, and feedback.

### Core features

React Native DevTools is based on the Chrome DevTools frontend. If you have a web development background, its features should be familiar. As a starting point, we recommend browsing the Chrome DevTools docs which contain full guides as well as video resources.

#### Console

The Console panel allows you to view and filter messages, evaluate JavaScript, inspect object properties, and more.

##### Useful tips

- If your app has a lot of logs, use the filter box or change the log levels that are shown.
- Watch values over time with Live Expressions.
- Persist messages across reloads with Preserve Logs.
- Use `Ctrl` + `L` to clear the console view.

#### Sources & breakpoints

The Sources panel allows you to view the source files in your app and register breakpoints. Use a breakpoint to define a line of code where your app should pause — allowing you to inspect the live state of the program and incrementally step through code.

tip

##### Mini-guide

Breakpoints are a fundamental tool in your debugging toolkit!

1. Navigate to a source file using the sidebar or `Cmd ⌘`+`P` / `Ctrl`+`P`.
2. Click in the line number column next to a line of code to add a breakpoint.
3. Use the navigation controls at the top right to step through code when paused.

##### Useful tips

- A "Paused in Debugger" overlay will appear when your app is paused. Tap it to resume.
- Pay attention to the right hand side panels when on a breakpoint, which allow you to inspect the current scope and call stack, and set watch expressions.
- Use a `debugger;` statement to quickly set a breakpoint from your text editor. This will reach the device immediately via Fast Refresh.
- There are multiple kinds of breakpoints! For example, Conditional Breakpoints and Logpoints.

#### Memory

The Memory panel allows you to take a heap snapshot and view the memory usage of your JavaScript code over time.

##### Useful tips

- Use `Cmd ⌘`+`F` / `Ctrl`+`F` to filter for specific objects in the heap.
- Taking an allocation timeline report can be useful to see memory usage over time as a graph, to identify possible memory leaks.

### React DevTools features

In the integrated Components and Profiler panels, you'll find all the features of the React DevTools browser extension. These work seamlessly in React Native DevTools.

#### React Components

The React Components panel allows you to inspect and update the rendered React component tree.

- Hover or select an element in DevTools to highlight it on device.
- To locate an element in DevTools, click the top-left "Select element" button, then tap any element in the app.

##### Useful tips

- Props and state on a component can be viewed and modified at runtime using the right hand panel.
- Components optimized with React Compiler will be annotated with a "Memo ✨" badge.

tip

##### Protip: Highlight re-renders

Re-renders can be a significant contributor to performance issues in React apps. DevTools can highlight component re-renders as they happen.

- To enable, click the View Settings (`⚙︎`) icon and check "Highlight updates when components render".

#### React Profiler

The React Profiler panel allows you to record performance profiles to understand the timing of component renders and React commits.

For more info, see the original 2018 guide (note that parts of this may be outdated).

### Reconnecting DevTools

Occasionally, DevTools might disconnect from the target device. This can happen if:

- The app is closed.
- The app is rebuilt (a new native build is installed).
- The app has crashed on the native side.
- The dev server (Metro) is quit.
- A physical device is disconnected.

On disconnect, a dialog will be shown with the message "Debugging connection was closed".

From here, you can either:

- **Dismiss**: Select the close (`×`) icon or click outside the dialog to return to the DevTools UI in the last state before disconnection.
- **Reconnect**: Select "Reconnect DevTools", having addressed the reason for disconnection.

React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.

## Views and mobile development

In Android and iOS development, a **view** is the basic building block of UI: a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display text, images, or respond to user input. Even the smallest visual elements of an app, like a line of text or a button, are kinds of views. Some kinds of views can contain other views. It’s views all the way down!

Just a sampling of the many views used in Android and iOS apps.

### Native Components

In Android development, you write views in Kotlin or Java; in iOS development, you use Swift or Objective-C. With React Native, you can invoke these views with JavaScript using React components. At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components. Because React Native components are backed by the same views as Android and iOS, React Native apps look, feel, and perform like any other apps. We call these platform-backed components **Native Components.**

React Native comes with a set of essential, ready-to-use Native Components you can use to start building your app today. These are React Native's **Core Components**.

caution

This documentation references a legacy set of API and needs to be updated to reflect the New Architecture

React Native also lets you build your own Native Components for Android and iOS to suit your app’s unique needs. We also have a thriving ecosystem of these **community-contributed components.** Check out Native Directory to find what the community has been creating.

### Core Components

React Native has many Core Components for everything from controls to activity indicators. You can find them all documented in the API section. You will mostly work with the following Core Components:

| React Native UI Component | Android View | iOS View | Web Analog | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<View>` | `<ViewGroup>` | `<UIView>` | A non-scrolling `<div>` | A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls |
| `<Text>` | `<TextView>` | `<UITextView>` | `<p>` | Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events |
| `<Image>` | `<ImageView>` | `<UIImageView>` | `<img>` | Displays different types of images |
| `<ScrollView>` | `<ScrollView>` | `<UIScrollView>` | `<div>` | A generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views |
| `<TextInput>` | `<EditText>` | `<UITextField>` | `<input type="text">` | Allows the user to enter text |

In the next section, you will start combining these Core Components to learn about how React works. Have a play with them here now!

---

Because React Native uses the same API structure as React components, you’ll need to understand React component APIs to get started. The next section makes for a quick introduction or refresher on the topic. However, if you’re already familiar with React, feel free to skip ahead.

A diagram showing React Native\&#x27;s Core Components are a subset of React Components that ship with React Native.

## React Fundamentals

React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:

- components
- JSX
- props
- state

If you want to dig deeper, we encourage you to check out React’s official documentation.

### Your first component

The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in. Here is your very first Cat component:

Here is how you do it: To define your `Cat` component, first use JavaScript’s `import` to import React and React Native’s `Text` Core Component:

```
import React from 'react';
import {Text} from 'react-native';
```

Your component starts as a function:

```
const Cat = () => {};
```

You can think of components as blueprints. Whatever a function component returns is rendered as a **React element.** React elements let you describe what you want to see on the screen.

Here the `Cat` component will render a `<Text>` element:

```
const Cat = () => {
  return <Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>;
};
```

You can export your function component with JavaScript’s `export default` for use throughout your app like so:

```
const Cat = () => {
  return <Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>;
};

export default Cat;
```

> This is one of many ways to export your component. This kind of export works well with the Snack Player. However, depending on your app’s file structure, you might need to use a different convention. This handy cheatsheet on JavaScript imports and exports can help.

Now take a closer look at that `return` statement. `<Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>` is using a kind of JavaScript syntax that makes writing elements convenient: JSX.

### JSX

React and React Native use **JSX,** a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: `<Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>`. The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, `name`, and embedding it with curly braces inside `<Text>`.

Any JavaScript expression will work between curly braces, including function calls like `{getFullName("Rum", "Tum", "Tugger")}`:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

You can think of curly braces as creating a portal into JS functionality in your JSX!

> Because JSX is included in the React library, it won’t work if you don’t have `import React from 'react'` at the top of your file!

### Custom Components

You’ve already met React Native’s Core Components. React lets you nest these components inside each other to create new components. These nestable, reusable components are at the heart of the React paradigm.

For example, you can nest `Text` and `TextInput` inside a `View` below, and React Native will render them together:

##### Developer notes

- Android
- Web

> If you’re familiar with web development, `<View>` and `<Text>` might remind you of HTML! You can think of them as the `<div>` and `<p>` tags of application development.

> On Android, you usually put your views inside `LinearLayout`, `FrameLayout`, `RelativeLayout`, etc. to define how the view’s children will be arranged on the screen. In React Native, `View` uses Flexbox for its children’s layout. You can learn more in our guide to layout with Flexbox.

You can render this component multiple times and in multiple places without repeating your code by using `<Cat>`:

Any component that renders other components is a **parent component.** Here, `Cafe` is the parent component and each `Cat` is a **child component.**

You can put as many cats in your cafe as you like. Each `<Cat>` renders a unique element—which you can customize with props.

### Props

**Props** is short for “properties”. Props let you customize React components. For example, here you pass each `<Cat>` a different `name` for `Cat` to render:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

Most of React Native’s Core Components can be customized with props, too. For example, when using `Image`, you pass it a prop named `source` to define what image it shows:

`Image` has many different props, including `style`, which accepts a JS object of design and layout related property-value pairs.

> Notice the double curly braces `{{ }}` surrounding `style`‘s width and height. In JSX, JavaScript values are referenced with `{}`. This is handy if you are passing something other than a string as props, like an array or number: `<Cat food={["fish", "kibble"]} age={2} />`. However, JS objects are **_also_** denoted with curly braces: `{width: 200, height: 200}`. Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in **another pair** of curly braces: `{{width: 200, height: 200}}`

You can build many things with props and the Core Components `Text`, `Image`, and `View`! But to build something interactive, you’ll need state.

### State

While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, **state** is like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

> As a general rule, use props to configure a component when it renders. Use state to keep track of any component data that you expect to change over time.

The following example takes place in a cat cafe where two hungry cats are waiting to be fed. Their hunger, which we expect to change over time (unlike their names), is stored as state. To feed the cats, press their buttons—which will update their state.

You can add state to a component by calling React’s `useState` Hook. A Hook is a kind of function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, `useState` is a Hook that lets you add state to function components. You can learn more about other kinds of Hooks in the React documentation.

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

First, you will want to import `useState` from React like so:

```
import React, {useState} from 'react';
```

Then you declare the component’s state by calling `useState` inside its function. In this example, `useState` creates an `isHungry` state variable:

```
const Cat = (props: CatProps) => {
  const [isHungry, setIsHungry] = useState(true);
  // ...
};
```

> You can use `useState` to track any kind of data: strings, numbers, Booleans, arrays, objects. For example, you can track the number of times a cat has been petted with `const [timesPetted, setTimesPetted] = useState(0)`!

Calling `useState` does two things:

- it creates a “state variable” with an initial value—in this case the state variable is `isHungry` and its initial value is `true`
- it creates a function to set that state variable’s value—`setIsHungry`

It doesn’t matter what names you use. But it can be handy to think of the pattern as `[<getter>, <setter>] = useState(<initialValue>)`.

Next you add the `Button` Core Component and give it an `onPress` prop:

```
<Button
  onPress={() => {
    setIsHungry(false);
  }}
  //..
/>
```

Now, when someone presses the button, `onPress` will fire, calling the `setIsHungry(false)`. This sets the state variable `isHungry` to `false`. When `isHungry` is false, the `Button`’s `disabled` prop is set to `true` and its `title` also changes:

```
<Button
  //..
  disabled={!isHungry}
  title={isHungry ? 'Give me some food, please!' : 'Thank you!'}
/>
```

> You might’ve noticed that although `isHungry` is a const, it is seemingly reassignable! What is happening is when a state-setting function like `setIsHungry` is called, its component will re-render. In this case the `Cat` function will run again—and this time, `useState` will give us the next value of `isHungry`.

Finally, put your cats inside a `Cafe` component:

```
const Cafe = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Cat name="Munkustrap" />
      <Cat name="Spot" />
    </>
  );
};
```

> See the `<>` and `</>` above? These bits of JSX are fragments. Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. Fragments let you do that without nesting an extra, unnecessary wrapping element like `View`.

---

Now that you’ve covered both React and React Native’s Core Components, let’s dive deeper on some of these core components by looking at handling `<TextInput>`.

## Handling Text Input

`TextInput` is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an `onChangeText` prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an `onSubmitEditing` prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.

For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "🍕 🍕 🍕".

In this example, we store `text` in the state, because it changes over time.

There are a lot more things you might want to do with a text input. For example, you could validate the text inside while the user types. For more detailed examples, see the React docs on controlled components, or the reference docs for TextInput.

Text input is one of the ways the user interacts with the app. Next, let's look at another type of input and learn how to handle touches.

## Debugging Native Code

#### Projects with Native Code Only

The following section only applies to projects with native code exposed. If you are using the managed Expo workflow, see the guide on prebuild to use this API.

### Accessing Logs

You can display the native logs for an iOS or Android app by using the following commands in a terminal while the app is running:

shell

```
# For Android:
npx react-native log-android
# Or, for iOS:
npx react-native log-ios
```

You may also access these through Debug > Open System Log… in the iOS Simulator or by running `adb logcat "*:S" ReactNative:V ReactNativeJS:V` in a terminal while an Android app is running on a device or emulator.

**💡 Custom Native Logs**

If you are writing a Native Module and want to add custom logs to your module for debugging purposes, you can use the following method:

##### Android (Java/Kotlin)

In your native module, use the `Log` class to add logs that can be viewed in Logcat:

java

```
import android.util.Log;

private void log(String message) {
    Log.d("YourModuleName", message);
}
```

To view these logs in Logcat, use this command, replacing `YourModuleName` with your custom tag:

shell

```
adb logcat "*:S" ReactNative:V ReactNativeJS:V YourModuleName:D
```

##### iOS (Objective-C/Swift)

In your native module, use `NSLog` for custom logs:

objective-c

```
NSLog(@"YourModuleName: %@", message);
```

Or, in Swift:

swift

```
print("YourModuleName: \(message)")
```

These logs will appear in the Xcode console when running the app.

### Debugging in a Native IDE

When working with native code, such as when writing native modules, you can launch the app from Android Studio or Xcode and take advantage of the native debugging features (setting up breakpoints, etc.) as you would in case of building a standard native app.

Another option is to run your application using the React Native CLI and attach the native debugger of the native IDE (Android Studio or Xcode) to the process.

#### Android Studio

On Android Studio you can do this by going on the "Run" option on the menu bar, clicking on "Attach to Process..." and selecting the running React Native app.

#### Xcode

On Xcode click on "Debug" on the top menu bar, select the "Attach to process" option, and select the application in the list of "Likely Targets".

## Using a ScrollView

The ScrollView is a generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views. The scrollable items can be heterogeneous, and you can scroll both vertically and horizontally (by setting the `horizontal` property).

This example creates a vertical `ScrollView` with both images and text mixed together.

ScrollViews can be configured to allow paging through views using swiping gestures by using the `pagingEnabled` props. Swiping horizontally between views can also be implemented on Android using the ViewPager component.

On iOS a ScrollView with a single item can be used to allow the user to zoom content. Set up the `maximumZoomScale` and `minimumZoomScale` props and your user will be able to use pinch and expand gestures to zoom in and out.

The ScrollView works best to present a small number of things of a limited size. All the elements and views of a `ScrollView` are rendered, even if they are not currently shown on the screen. If you have a long list of items which cannot fit on the screen, you should use a `FlatList` instead. So let's learn about list views next.

## Debugging Release Builds

### Symbolicating a stack trace

If a React Native app throws an unhandled exception in a release build, the output may be obfuscated and hard to read.

shell

```
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: mqt_native_modules
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: Process: com.awesomeproject, PID: 18979 07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: com.facebook.react.common.JavascriptException: Failed, js engine: hermes, stack:
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: p@1:132161
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: p@1:132084
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: f@1:131854
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: anonymous@1:131119
```

In the above stack trace, entries like `p@1:132161` are minified function names and bytecode offsets. To debug these calls, we want to translate these into file, line, and function name, e.g. `AwesomeProject/App.js:54:initializeMap`. This is known as **symbolication.**

You can symbolicate minified function names and bytecode like the above by passing the stack trace and a generated source map to `metro-symbolicate`.

#### Enabling source maps

Source maps are required to symbolicate stack traces. Make sure that source maps are enabled within the build config for the target platform.

- Android
- iOS

info

On Android, source maps are **enabled** by default.

To enable source map generation, ensure the following `hermesFlags` are present in `android/app/build.gradle`.

groovy

```
react {
    hermesFlags = ["-O", "-output-source-map"]
}
```

If done correctly you should see the output location of the source map during Metro build output.

text

```
Writing bundle output to:, android/app/build/generated/assets/react/release/index.android.bundle
Writing sourcemap output to:, android/app/build/intermediates/sourcemaps/react/release/index.android.bundle.packager.map
```

info

On iOS, source maps are **disabled** by default. Use the following instructions to enable them.

To enable source map generation:

- Open Xcode and edit the build phase "Bundle React Native code and images".
- Above the other exports, add a `SOURCEMAP_FILE` entry with the desired output path.

diff

```
+ SOURCEMAP_FILE="$(pwd)/../main.jsbundle.map";
  WITH_ENVIRONMENT="../node_modules/react-native/scripts/xcode/with-environment.sh"
```

If done correctly you should see the output location of the source map during Metro build output.

text

```
Writing bundle output to:, Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/application/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos/main.jsbundle
Writing sourcemap output to:, Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/application/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos/main.jsbundle.map
```

#### Using `metro-symbolicate`

With source maps being generated, we can now translate our stack traces.

shell

```
# Print usage instructions
npx metro-symbolicate

# From a file containing the stack trace
npx metro-symbolicate android/app/build/generated/sourcemaps/react/release/index.android.bundle.map < stacktrace.txt

# From adb logcat (Android)
adb logcat -d | npx metro-symbolicate android/app/build/generated/sourcemaps/react/release/index.android.bundle.map
```

#### Notes on source maps

- Multiple source maps may be generated by the build process. Make sure to use the one in the location shown in the examples.
- Make sure that the source map you use corresponds to the exact commit of the crashing app. Small changes in source code can cause large differences in offsets.
- If `metro-symbolicate` exits immediately with success, make sure the input comes from a pipe or redirection and not from a terminal.

## Using List Views

React Native provides a suite of components for presenting lists of data. Generally, you'll want to use either FlatList or SectionList.

The `FlatList` component displays a scrolling list of changing, but similarly structured, data. `FlatList` works well for long lists of data, where the number of items might change over time. Unlike the more generic `ScrollView`, the `FlatList` only renders elements that are currently showing on the screen, not all the elements at once.

The `FlatList` component requires two props: `data` and `renderItem`. `data` is the source of information for the list. `renderItem` takes one item from the source and returns a formatted component to render.

This example creates a basic `FlatList` of hardcoded data. Each item in the `data` props is rendered as a `Text` component. The `FlatListBasics` component then renders the `FlatList` and all `Text` components.

If you want to render a set of data broken into logical sections, maybe with section headers, similar to `UITableView`s on iOS, then a SectionList is the way to go.

One of the most common uses for a list view is displaying data that you fetch from a server. To do that, you will need to learn about networking in React Native.

## Platform-Specific Code

When building a cross-platform app, you'll want to re-use as much code as possible. Scenarios may arise where it makes sense for the code to be different, for example you may want to implement separate visual components for Android and iOS.

React Native provides two ways to organize your code and separate it by platform:

- Using the `Platform` module.
- Using platform-specific file extensions.

Certain components may have properties that work on one platform only. All of these props are annotated with `@platform` and have a small badge next to them on the website.

### Platform module

React Native provides a module that detects the platform in which the app is running. You can use the detection logic to implement platform-specific code. Use this option when only small parts of a component are platform-specific.

```
import {Platform, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  height: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 200 : 100,
});
```

`Platform.OS` will be `ios` when running on iOS and `android` when running on Android.

There is also a `Platform.select` method available that, given an object where keys can be one of `'ios' | 'android' | 'native' | 'default'`, returns the most fitting value for the platform you are currently running on. That is, if you're running on a phone, `ios` and `android` keys will take preference. If those are not specified, `native` key will be used and then the `default` key.

```
import {Platform, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: {
        backgroundColor: 'red',
      },
      android: {
        backgroundColor: 'green',
      },
      default: {
        // other platforms, web for example
        backgroundColor: 'blue',
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

This will result in a container having `flex: 1` on all platforms, a red background color on iOS, a green background color on Android, and a blue background color on other platforms.

Since it accepts `any` value, you can also use it to return platform-specific components, like below:

```
const Component = Platform.select({
  ios: () => require('ComponentIOS'),
  android: () => require('ComponentAndroid'),
})();

<Component />;
```

```
const Component = Platform.select({
  native: () => require('ComponentForNative'),
  default: () => require('ComponentForWeb'),
})();

<Component />;
```

#### Detecting the Android versionAndroid

On Android, the `Platform` module can also be used to detect the version of the Android Platform in which the app is running:

```
import {Platform} from 'react-native';

if (Platform.Version === 25) {
  console.log('Running on Nougat!');
}
```

**Note**: `Version` is set to the Android API version not the Android OS version. To find a mapping please refer to Android Version History.

#### Detecting the iOS versioniOS

On iOS, the `Version` is a result of `-[UIDevice systemVersion]`, which is a string with the current version of the operating system. An example of the system version is "10.3". For example, to detect the major version number on iOS:

```
import {Platform} from 'react-native';

const majorVersionIOS = parseInt(Platform.Version, 10);
if (majorVersionIOS <= 9) {
  console.log('Work around a change in behavior');
}
```

### Platform-specific extensions

When your platform-specific code is more complex, you should consider splitting the code out into separate files. React Native will detect when a file has a `.ios.` or `.android.` extension and load the relevant platform file when required from other components.

For example, say you have the following files in your project:

shell

```
BigButton.ios.js
BigButton.android.js
```

You can then import the component as follows:

```
import BigButton from './BigButton';
```

React Native will automatically pick up the right file based on the running platform.

### Native-specific extensions (i.e. sharing code with NodeJS and Web)

You can also use the `.native.js` extension when a module needs to be shared between NodeJS/Web and React Native but it has no Android/iOS differences. This is especially useful for projects that have common code shared among React Native and ReactJS.

For example, say you have the following files in your project:

shell

```
Container.js # picked up by webpack, Rollup or any other Web bundler
Container.native.js # picked up by the React Native bundler for both Android and iOS (Metro)
```

You can still import it without the `.native` extension, as follows:

```
import Container from './Container';
```

**Pro tip:** Configure your Web bundler to ignore `.native.js` extensions in order to avoid having unused code in your production bundle, thus reducing the final bundle size.

## Other Debugging Methods

This page covers how to use legacy JavaScript debugging methods. If you are getting started with a new React Native or Expo app, we recommend using React Native DevTools.

### Safari Developer Tools (direct JSC debugging)

You can use Safari to debug the iOS version of your app when using JavaScriptCore (JSC) as your app's runtime.

1. **Physical devices only**: Open the Settings app, and navigate to Safari > Advanced, and make sure "Web Inspector" is turned on.
2. On your Mac, open Safari and enable the Develop menu. This can be found under Safari > Settings..., then the Advanced tab, then selecting "Show features for web developers".
3. Find your device under the Develop menu, and select the "JSContext" item from the submenu. This will open Safari's Web Inspector, which includes Console and Sources panels similar to Chrome DevTools.

tip

While source maps may not be enabled by default, you can follow this guide or video to enable them and set break points at the right places in the source code.

tip

Every time the app is reloaded, a new JSContext is created. Choosing "Automatically Show Web Inspectors for JSContexts" saves you from having to select the latest JSContext manually.

### Remote JavaScript Debugging (removed)

## Testing

As your codebase expands, small errors and edge cases you don’t expect can cascade into larger failures. Bugs lead to bad user experience and ultimately, business losses. One way to prevent fragile programming is to test your code before releasing it into the wild.

In this guide, we will cover different, automated ways to ensure your app works as expected, ranging from static analysis to end-to-end tests.

### Why Test

We're humans, and humans make mistakes. Testing is important because it helps you uncover these mistakes and verifies that your code is working. Perhaps even more importantly, testing ensures that your code continues to work in the future as you add new features, refactor the existing ones, or upgrade major dependencies of your project.

There is more value in testing than you might realize. One of the best ways to fix a bug in your code is to write a failing test that exposes it. Then when you fix the bug and re-run the test, if it passes it means the bug is fixed, never reintroduced into the code base.

Tests can also serve as documentation for new people joining your team. For people who have never seen a codebase before, reading tests can help them understand how the existing code works.

Last but not least, more automated testing means less time spent with manual QA, freeing up valuable time.

### Static Analysis

The first step to improve your code quality is to start using static analysis tools. Static analysis checks your code for errors as you write it, but without running any of that code.

- **Linters** analyze code to catch common errors such as unused code and to help avoid pitfalls, to flag style guide no-nos like using tabs instead of spaces (or vice versa, depending on your configuration).
- **Type checking** ensures that the construct you’re passing to a function matches what the function was designed to accept, preventing passing a string to a counting function that expects a number, for instance.

React Native comes with two such tools configured out of the box: ESLint for linting and TypeScript for type checking.

### Writing Testable Code

To start with tests, you first need to write code that is testable. Consider an aircraft manufacturing process - before any model first takes off to show that all of its complex systems work well together, individual parts are tested to guarantee they are safe and function correctly. For example, wings are tested by bending them under extreme load; engine parts are tested for their durability; the windshield is tested against simulated bird impact.

Software is similar. Instead of writing your entire program in one huge file with many lines of code, you write your code in multiple small modules that you can test more thoroughly than if you tested the assembled whole. In this way, writing testable code is intertwined with writing clean, modular code.

To make your app more testable, start by separating the view part of your app—your React components—from your business logic and app state (regardless of whether you use Redux, MobX or other solutions). This way, you can keep your business logic testing—which shouldn’t rely on your React components—independent of the components themselves, whose job is primarily rendering your app’s UI!

Theoretically, you could go so far as to move all logic and data fetching out of your components. This way your components would be solely dedicated to rendering. Your state would be entirely independent of your components. Your app’s logic would work without any React components at all!

> We encourage you to further explore the topic of testable code in other learning resources.

### Writing Tests

After writing testable code, it’s time to write some actual tests! The default template of React Native ships with Jest testing framework. It includes a preset that's tailored to this environment so you can get productive without tweaking the configuration and mocks straight away—more on mocks shortly. You can use Jest to write all types of tests featured in this guide.

> If you do test-driven development, you actually write tests first! That way, testability of your code is given.

#### Structuring Tests

Your tests should be short and ideally test only one thing. Let's start with an example unit test written with Jest:

js

```
it('given a date in the past, colorForDueDate() returns red', () => {
  expect(colorForDueDate('2000-10-20')).toBe('red');
});
```

The test is described by the string passed to the `it` function. Take good care writing the description so that it’s clear what is being tested. Do your best to cover the following:

1. **Given** - some precondition
2. **When** - some action executed by the function that you’re testing
3. **Then** - the expected outcome

This is also known as AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert).

Jest offers `describe` function to help structure your tests. Use `describe` to group together all tests that belong to one functionality. Describes can be nested, if you need that. Other functions you'll commonly use are `beforeEach` or `beforeAll` that you can use for setting up the objects you're testing. Read more in the Jest api reference.

If your test has many steps or many expectations, you probably want to split it into multiple smaller ones. Also, ensure that your tests are completely independent of one another. Each test in your suite must be executable on its own without first running some other test. Conversely, if you run all your tests together, the first test must not influence the output of the second one.

Lastly, as developers we like when our code works great and doesn't crash. With tests, this is often the opposite. Think of a failed test as of a _good thing!_ When a test fails, it often means something is not right. This gives you an opportunity to fix the problem before it impacts the users.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests cover the smallest parts of code, like individual functions or classes.

When the object being tested has any dependencies, you’ll often need to mock them out, as described in the next paragraph.

The great thing about unit tests is that they are quick to write and run. Therefore, as you work, you get fast feedback about whether your tests are passing. Jest even has an option to continuously run tests that are related to code you’re editing: Watch mode.

#### Mocking

Sometimes, when your tested objects have external dependencies, you’ll want to “mock them out.” “Mocking” is when you replace some dependency of your code with your own implementation.

> Generally, using real objects in your tests is better than using mocks but there are situations where this is not possible. For example: when your JS unit test relies on a native module written in Java or Objective-C.

Imagine you’re writing an app that shows the current weather in your city and you’re using some external service or other dependency that provides you with the weather information. If the service tells you that it’s raining, you want to show an image with a rainy cloud. You don’t want to call that service in your tests, because:

- It could make the tests slow and unstable (because of the network requests involved)
- The service may return different data every time you run the test
- Third party services can go offline when you really need to run tests!

Therefore, you can provide a mock implementation of the service, effectively replacing thousands of lines of code and some internet-connected thermometers!

> Jest comes with support for mocking from function level all the way to module level mocking.

### Integration Tests

When writing larger software systems, individual pieces of it need to interact with each other. In unit testing, if your unit depends on another one, you’ll sometimes end up mocking the dependency, replacing it with a fake one.

In integration testing, real individual units are combined (same as in your app) and tested together to ensure that their cooperation works as expected. This is not to say that mocking does not happen here: you’ll still need mocks (for example, to mock communication with a weather service), but you'll need them much less than in unit testing.

> Please note that the terminology around what integration testing means is not always consistent. Also, the line between what is a unit test and what is an integration test may not always be clear. For this guide, your test falls into "integration testing" if it:
>
> - Combines several modules of your app as described above
> - Uses an external system
> - Makes a network call to other application (such as the weather service API)
> - Does any kind of file or database I/O

### Component Tests

React components are responsible for rendering your app, and users will directly interact with their output. Even if your app's business logic has high testing coverage and is correct, without component tests you may still deliver a broken UI to your users. Component tests could fall into both unit and integration testing, but because they are such a core part of React Native, we'll cover them separately.

For testing React components, there are two things you may want to test:

- Interaction: to ensure the component behaves correctly when interacted with by a user (eg. when user presses a button)
- Rendering: to ensure the component render output used by React is correct (eg. the button's appearance and placement in the UI)

For example, if you have a button that has an `onPress` listener, you want to test that the button both appears correctly and that tapping the button is correctly handled by the component.

There are several libraries that can help you testing these:

- React’s Test Renderer, developed alongside its core, provides a React renderer that can be used to render React components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment.
- React Native Testing Library builds on top of React’s test renderer and adds `fireEvent` and `query` APIs described in the next paragraph.

> Component tests are only JavaScript tests running in Node.js environment. They do _not_ take into account any iOS, Android, or other platform code which is backing the React Native components. It follows that they cannot give you a 100% confidence that everything works for the user. If there is a bug in the iOS or Android code, they will not find it.

#### Testing User Interactions

Aside from rendering some UI, your components handle events like `onChangeText` for `TextInput` or `onPress` for `Button`. They may also contain other functions and event callbacks. Consider the following example:

```
function GroceryShoppingList() {
  const [groceryItem, setGroceryItem] = useState('');
  const [items, setItems] = useState<string[]>([]);

  const addNewItemToShoppingList = useCallback(() => {
    setItems([groceryItem, ...items]);
    setGroceryItem('');
  }, [groceryItem, items]);

  return (
    <>
      <TextInput
        value={groceryItem}
        placeholder="Enter grocery item"
        onChangeText={text => setGroceryItem(text)}
      />
      <Button
        title="Add the item to list"
        onPress={addNewItemToShoppingList}
      />
      {items.map(item => (
        <Text key={item}>{item}</Text>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

When testing user interactions, test the component from the user perspective—what's on the page? What changes when interacted with?

As a rule of thumb, prefer using things users can see or hear:

- make assertions using rendered text or accessibility helpers

Conversely, you should avoid:

- making assertions on component props or state
- testID queries

Avoid testing implementation details like props or state—while such tests work, they are not oriented toward how users will interact with the component and tend to break by refactoring (for example when you'd like to rename some things or rewrite class component using hooks).

> React class components are especially prone to testing their implementation details such as internal state, props or event handlers. To avoid testing implementation details, prefer using function components with Hooks, which make relying on component internals _harder_.

Component testing libraries such as React Native Testing Library facilitate writing user-centric tests by careful choice of provided APIs. The following example uses `fireEvent` methods `changeText` and `press` that simulate a user interacting with the component and a query function `getAllByText` that finds matching `Text` nodes in the rendered output.

```
test('given empty GroceryShoppingList, user can add an item to it', () => {
  const {getByPlaceholderText, getByText, getAllByText} = render(
    <GroceryShoppingList />,
  );

  fireEvent.changeText(
    getByPlaceholderText('Enter grocery item'),
    'banana',
  );
  fireEvent.press(getByText('Add the item to list'));

  const bananaElements = getAllByText('banana');
  expect(bananaElements).toHaveLength(1); // expect 'banana' to be on the list
});
```

This example is not testing how some state changes when you call a function. It tests what happens when a user changes text in the `TextInput` and presses the `Button`!

#### Testing Rendered Output

Snapshot testing is an advanced kind of testing enabled by Jest. It is a very powerful and low-level tool, so extra attention is advised when using it.

A "component snapshot" is a JSX-like string created by a custom React serializer built into Jest. This serializer lets Jest translate React component trees to string that's human-readable. Put another way: a component snapshot is a textual representation of your component’s render output _generated_ during a test run. It may look like this:

```
<Text
  style={
    Object {
      "fontSize": 20,
      "textAlign": "center",
    }
  }>
  Welcome to React Native!
</Text>
```

With snapshot testing, you typically first implement your component and then run the snapshot test. The snapshot test then creates a snapshot and saves it to a file in your repo as a reference snapshot. **The file is then committed and checked during code review**. Any future changes to the component render output will change its snapshot, which will cause the test to fail. You then need to update the stored reference snapshot for the test to pass. That change again needs to be committed and reviewed.

Snapshots have several weak points:

- For you as a developer or reviewer, it can be hard to tell whether a change in snapshot is intended or whether it's evidence of a bug. Especially large snapshots can quickly become hard to understand and their added value becomes low.
- When snapshot is created, at that point it is considered to be correct-even in the case when the rendered output is actually wrong.
- When a snapshot fails, it's tempting to update it using the `--updateSnapshot` jest option without taking proper care to investigate whether the change is expected. Certain developer discipline is thus needed.

Snapshots themselves do not ensure that your component render logic is correct, they are merely good at guarding against unexpected changes and for checking that the components in the React tree under test receive the expected props (styles and etc.).

We recommend that you only use small snapshots (see `no-large-snapshots` rule). If you want to test a _change_ between two React component states, use `snapshot-diff`. When in doubt, prefer explicit expectations as described in the previous paragraph.

### End-to-End Tests

In end-to-end (E2E) tests, you verify your app is working as expected on a device (or a simulator / emulator) from the user perspective.

This is done by building your app in the release configuration and running the tests against it. In E2E tests, you no longer think about React components, React Native APIs, Redux stores or any business logic. That is not the purpose of E2E tests and those are not even accessible to you during E2E testing.

Instead, E2E testing libraries allow you to find and control elements in the screen of your app: for example, you can _actually_ tap buttons or insert text into `TextInputs` the same way a real user would. Then you can make assertions about whether or not a certain element exists in the app’s screen, whether or not it’s visible, what text it contains, and so on.

E2E tests give you the highest possible confidence that part of your app is working. The tradeoffs include:

- writing them is more time consuming compared to the other types of tests
- they are slower to run
- they are more prone to flakiness (a "flaky" test is a test which randomly passes and fails without any change to code)

Try to cover the vital parts of your app with E2E tests: authentication flow, core functionalities, payments, etc. Use faster JS tests for the non-vital parts of your app. The more tests you add, the higher your confidence, but also, the more time you'll spend maintaining and running them. Consider the tradeoffs and decide what's best for you.

There are several E2E testing tools available: in the React Native community, Detox is a popular framework because it’s tailored for React Native apps. Another popular library in the space of iOS and Android apps is Appium or Maestro.

### Summary

We hope you enjoyed reading and learned something from this guide. There are many ways you can test your apps. It may be hard to decide what to use at first. However, we believe it all will make sense once you start adding tests to your awesome React Native app. So what are you waiting for? Get your coverage up!

## Performance Overview

A compelling reason to use React Native instead of WebView-based tools is to achieve at least 60 frames per second and provide a native look and feel to your apps. Whenever feasible, we aim for React Native to handle optimizations automatically, allowing you to focus on your app without worrying about performance. However, there are certain areas where we haven't quite reached that level yet, and others where React Native (similar to writing native code directly) cannot determine the best optimization approach for you. In such cases, manual intervention becomes necessary. We strive to deliver buttery-smooth UI performance by default, but there may be instances where that isn't possible.

This guide is intended to teach you some basics to help you to troubleshoot performance issues, as well as discuss common sources of problems and their suggested solutions.

### What you need to know about frames

Your grandparents' generation called movies "moving pictures" for a reason: realistic motion in video is an illusion created by quickly changing static images at a consistent speed. We refer to each of these images as frames. The number of frames that is displayed each second has a direct impact on how smooth and ultimately life-like a video (or user interface) seems to be. iOS devices display at least 60 frames per second, which gives you and the UI system at most 16.67ms to do all of the work needed to generate the static image (frame) that the user will see on the screen for that interval. If you are unable to do the work necessary to generate that frame within the allotted time slot, then you will "drop a frame" and the UI will appear unresponsive.

Now to confuse the matter a little bit, open up the Dev Menu in your app and toggle `Show Perf Monitor`. You will notice that there are two different frame rates.

#### JS frame rate (JavaScript thread)

For most React Native applications, your business logic will run on the JavaScript thread. This is where your React application lives, API calls are made, touch events are processed, etc... Updates to native-backed views are batched and sent over to the native side at the end of each iteration of the event loop, before the frame deadline (if all goes well). If the JavaScript thread is unresponsive for a frame, it will be considered a dropped frame. For example, if you were to call `this.setState` on the root component of a complex application and it resulted in re-rendering computationally expensive component subtrees, it's conceivable that this might take 200ms and result in 12 frames being dropped. Any animations controlled by JavaScript would appear to freeze during that time. If anything takes longer than 100ms, the user will feel it.

This often happens during `Navigator` transitions: when you push a new route, the JavaScript thread needs to render all of the components necessary for the scene in order to send over the proper commands to the native side to create the backing views. It's common for the work being done here to take a few frames and cause jank because the transition is controlled by the JavaScript thread. Sometimes components will do additional work on `componentDidMount`, which might result in a second stutter in the transition.

Another example is responding to touches: if you are doing work across multiple frames on the JavaScript thread, you might notice a delay in responding to `TouchableOpacity`, for example. This is because the JavaScript thread is busy and cannot process the raw touch events sent over from the main thread. As a result, `TouchableOpacity` cannot react to the touch events and command the native view to adjust its opacity.

#### UI frame rate (main thread)

Many people have noticed that performance of `NavigatorIOS` is better out of the box than `Navigator`. The reason for this is that the animations for the transitions are done entirely on the main thread, and so they are not interrupted by frame drops on the JavaScript thread.

Similarly, you can happily scroll up and down through a `ScrollView` when the JavaScript thread is locked up because the `ScrollView` lives on the main thread. The scroll events are dispatched to the JS thread, but their receipt is not necessary for the scroll to occur.

### Common sources of performance problems

#### Running in development mode (`dev=true`)

JavaScript thread performance suffers greatly when running in dev mode. This is unavoidable: a lot more work needs to be done at runtime to provide you with good warnings and error messages. Always make sure to test performance in release builds.

#### Using `console.log` statements

When running a bundled app, these statements can cause a big bottleneck in the JavaScript thread. This includes calls from debugging libraries such as redux-logger, so make sure to remove them before bundling. You can also use this babel plugin that removes all the `console.*` calls. You need to install it first with `npm i babel-plugin-transform-remove-console --save-dev`, and then edit the `.babelrc` file under your project directory like this:

json

```
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "plugins": ["transform-remove-console"]
    }
  }
}
```

This will automatically remove all `console.*` calls in the release (production) versions of your project.

It is recommended to use the plugin even if no `console.*` calls are made in your project. A third party library could also call them.

#### `ListView` initial rendering is too slow or scroll performance is bad for large lists

Use the new `FlatList` or `SectionList` component instead. Besides simplifying the API, the new list components also have significant performance enhancements, the main one being nearly constant memory usage for any number of rows.

If your `FlatList` is rendering slow, be sure that you've implemented `getItemLayout` to optimize rendering speed by skipping measurement of the rendered items.

#### JS FPS plunges when re-rendering a view that hardly changes

If you are using a ListView, you must provide a `rowHasChanged` function that can reduce a lot of work by quickly determining whether or not a row needs to be re-rendered. If you are using immutable data structures, this would only need to be a reference equality check.

Similarly, you can implement `shouldComponentUpdate` and indicate the exact conditions under which you would like the component to re-render. If you write pure components (where the return value of the render function is entirely dependent on props and state), you can leverage PureComponent to do this for you. Once again, immutable data structures are useful to keep this fast -- if you have to do a deep comparison of a large list of objects, it may be that re-rendering your entire component would be quicker, and it would certainly require less code.

#### Dropping JS thread FPS because of doing a lot of work on the JavaScript thread at the same time

"Slow Navigator transitions" is the most common manifestation of this, but there are other times this can happen. Using InteractionManager can be a good approach, but if the user experience cost is too high to delay work during an animation, then you might want to consider LayoutAnimation.

The Animated API currently calculates each keyframe on-demand on the JavaScript thread unless you set `useNativeDriver: true`, while LayoutAnimation leverages Core Animation and is unaffected by JS thread and main thread frame drops.

One case where I have used this is for animating in a modal (sliding down from top and fading in a translucent overlay) while initializing and perhaps receiving responses for several network requests, rendering the contents of the modal, and updating the view where the modal was opened from. See the Animations guide for more information about how to use LayoutAnimation.

Caveats:

- LayoutAnimation only works for fire-and-forget animations ("static" animations) -- if it must be interruptible, you will need to use `Animated`.

#### Moving a view on the screen (scrolling, translating, rotating) drops UI thread FPS

This is especially true when you have text with a transparent background positioned on top of an image, or any other situation where alpha compositing would be required to re-draw the view on each frame. You will find that enabling `shouldRasterizeIOS` or `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid` can help with this significantly.

Be careful not to overuse this or your memory usage could go through the roof. Profile your performance and memory usage when using these props. If you don't plan to move a view anymore, turn this property off.

#### Animating the size of an image drops UI thread FPS

On iOS, each time you adjust the width or height of an Image component it is re-cropped and scaled from the original image. This can be very expensive, especially for large images. Instead, use the `transform: [{scale}]` style property to animate the size. An example of when you might do this is when you tap an image and zoom it in to full screen.

#### My TouchableX view isn't very responsive

Sometimes, if we do an action in the same frame that we are adjusting the opacity or highlight of a component that is responding to a touch, we won't see that effect until after the `onPress` function has returned. If `onPress` does a `setState` that results in a lot of work and a few frames dropped, this may occur. A solution to this is to wrap any action inside of your `onPress` handler in `requestAnimationFrame`:

```
handleOnPress() {
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    this.doExpensiveAction();
  });
}
```

#### Slow navigator transitions

As mentioned above, `Navigator` animations are controlled by the JavaScript thread. Imagine the "push from right" scene transition: each frame, the new scene is moved from the right to left, starting offscreen (let's say at an x-offset of 320) and ultimately settling when the scene sits at an x-offset of 0. Each frame during this transition, the JavaScript thread needs to send a new x-offset to the main thread. If the JavaScript thread is locked up, it cannot do this and so no update occurs on that frame and the animation stutters.

One solution to this is to allow for JavaScript-based animations to be offloaded to the main thread. If we were to do the same thing as in the above example with this approach, we might calculate a list of all x-offsets for the new scene when we are starting the transition and send them to the main thread to execute in an optimized way. Now that the JavaScript thread is freed of this responsibility, it's not a big deal if it drops a few frames while rendering the scene -- you probably won't even notice because you will be too distracted by the pretty transition.

Solving this is one of the main goals behind the new React Navigation library. The views in React Navigation use native components and the `Animated` library to deliver at least 60 FPS animations that are run on the native thread.

## BackHandler

The Backhandler API detects hardware button presses for back navigation, lets you register event listeners for the system's back action, and lets you control how your application responds. It is Android-only.

The event subscriptions are called in reverse order (i.e. the last registered subscription is called first).

- **If one subscription returns true,** then subscriptions registered earlier will not be called.
- **If no subscription returns true or none are registered,** it programmatically invokes the default back button functionality to exit the app.

> **Warning for modal users:** If your app shows an opened `Modal`, `BackHandler` will not publish any events (see `Modal` docs).

### Pattern

```
const subscription = BackHandler.addEventListener(
  'hardwareBackPress',
  function () {
    /**
     * this.onMainScreen and this.goBack are just examples,
     * you need to use your own implementation here.
     *
     * Typically you would use the navigator here to go to the last state.
     */

    if (!this.onMainScreen()) {
      this.goBack();
      /**
       * When true is returned the event will not be bubbled up
       * & no other back action will execute
       */
      return true;
    }
    /**
     * Returning false will let the event to bubble up & let other event listeners
     * or the system's default back action to be executed.
     */
    return false;
  },
);

// Unsubscribe the listener on unmount
subscription.remove();
```

### Example

The following example implements a scenario where you confirm if the user wants to exit the app:

`BackHandler.addEventListener` creates an event listener & returns a `NativeEventSubscription` object which should be cleared using `NativeEventSubscription.remove` method.

### Usage with React Navigation

If you are using React Navigation to navigate across different screens, you can follow their guide on Custom Android back button behaviour

### Backhandler hook

React Native Hooks has a nice `useBackHandler` hook which will simplify the process of setting up event listeners.

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `addEventListener()`

```
static addEventListener(
  eventName: BackPressEventName,
  handler: () => boolean | null | undefined,
): NativeEventSubscription;
```

---

#### `exitApp()`

```
static exitApp();
```

Building your React Native app could be **expensive** and take several minutes of developers time. This can be problematic as your project grows and generally in bigger organizations with multiple React Native developers.

To mitigate this performance hit, this page shares some suggestions on how to **improve your build time**.

info

Please note that those suggestions are advanced feature that requires some amount of understanding of how the native build tools work.

## Build only one ABI during development (Android-only)

When building your android app locally, by default you build all the 4 Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs) : `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, `x86` & `x86_64`.

However, you probably don't need to build all of them if you're building locally and testing your emulator or on a physical device.

This should reduce your **native build time** by a \~75% factor.

If you're using the React Native CLI, you can add the `--active-arch-only` flag to the `run-android` command. This flag will make sure the correct ABI is picked up from either the running emulator or the plugged in phone. To confirm that this approach is working fine, you'll see a message like `info Detected architectures arm64-v8a` on console.

```
$ yarn react-native run-android --active-arch-only

[ ... ]
info Running jetifier to migrate libraries to AndroidX. You can disable it using "--no-jetifier" flag.
Jetifier found 1037 file(s) to forward-jetify. Using 32 workers...
info JS server already running.
info Detected architectures arm64-v8a
info Installing the app...
```

This mechanism relies on the `reactNativeArchitectures` Gradle property.

Therefore, if you're building directly with Gradle from the command line and without the CLI, you can specify the ABI you want to build as follows:

```
$ ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug -PreactNativeArchitectures=x86,x86_64
```

This can be useful if you wish to build your Android App on a CI and use a matrix to parallelize the build of the different architectures.

If you wish, you can also override this value locally, using the `gradle.properties` file you have in the top-level folder of your project:

```
# Use this property to specify which architecture you want to build.
# You can also override it from the CLI using
# ./gradlew <task> -PreactNativeArchitectures=x86_64
reactNativeArchitectures=armeabi-v7a,arm64-v8a,x86,x86_64
```

Once you build a **release version** of your app, don't forget to remove those flags as you want to build an apk/app bundle that works for all the ABIs and not only for the one you're using in your daily development workflow.

### Enable Configuration Caching (Android-only)

Since React Native 0.79, you can also enable Gradle Configuration Caching.

When you’re running an Android build with `yarn android`, you will be executing a Gradle build that is composed by two steps (source):

- Configuration phase, when all the `.gradle` files are evaluated.
- Execution phase, when the tasks are actually executed so the Java/Kotlin code is compiled and so on.

You will now be able to enable Configuration Caching, which will allow you to skip the Configuration phase on subsequent builds.

This is beneficial when making frequent changes to the native code as it improves build times.

For example here you can see how rebuilding faster it is to rebuild RN-Tester after a change in the native code:

You can enable Gradle Configuration Caching by adding the following line in your `android/gradle.properties` file:

```
org.gradle.configuration-cache=true
```

Please refer to the official Gradle documentation for more resources on Configuration Caching.

### Use a compiler cache

If you're running frequent native builds (either C++ or Objective-C), you might benefit from using a **compiler cache**.

Specifically you can use two type of caches: local compiler caches and distributed compiler caches.

#### Local caches

info

The following instructions will work for **both Android & iOS**. If you're building only Android apps, you should be good to go. If you're building also iOS apps, please follow the instructions in the XCode Specific Setup section below.

We suggest to use **ccache** to cache the compilation of your native builds. Ccache works by wrapping the C++ compilers, storing the compilation results, and skipping the compilation if an intermediate compilation result was originally stored.

Ccache is available in the package manager for most operating systems. On macOS, we can install ccache with `brew install ccache`. Or you can follow the official installation instructions to install from source.

You can then do two clean builds (e.g. on Android you can first run `yarn react-native run-android`, delete the `android/app/build` folder and run the first command once more). You will notice that the second build was way faster than the first one (it should take seconds rather than minutes). While building, you can verify that `ccache` works correctly and check the cache hits/miss rate `ccache -s`

```
$ ccache -s
Summary:
  Hits:             196 /  3068 (6.39 %)
    Direct:           0 /  3068 (0.00 %)
    Preprocessed:   196 /  3068 (6.39 %)
  Misses:          2872
    Direct:        3068
    Preprocessed:  2872
  Uncacheable:        1
Primary storage:
  Hits:             196 /  6136 (3.19 %)
  Misses:          5940
  Cache size (GB): 0.60 / 20.00 (3.00 %)
```

Note that `ccache` aggregates the stats over all builds. You can use `ccache --zero-stats` to reset them before a build to verify the cache-hit ratio.

Should you need to wipe your cache, you can do so with `ccache --clear`

##### XCode Specific Setup

To make sure `ccache` works correctly with iOS and XCode, you need to enable React Native support for ccache in `ios/Podfile`.

Open `ios/Podfile` in your editor and uncomment the `ccache_enabled` line.

ruby

```
  post_install do |installer|
    # https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/react-native/scripts/react_native_pods.rb#L197-L202
    react_native_post_install(
      installer,
      config[:reactNativePath],
      :mac_catalyst_enabled => false,
      # TODO: Uncomment the line below
      :ccache_enabled => true
    )
  end
```

##### Using this approach on a CI

Ccache uses the `/Users/$USER/Library/Caches/ccache` folder on macOS to store the cache. Therefore you could save & restore the corresponding folder also on CI to speedup your builds.

However, there are a couple of things to be aware:

1. On CI, we recommend to do a full clean build, to avoid poisoned cache problems. If you follow the approach mentioned in the previous paragraph, you should be able to parallelize the native build on 4 different ABIs and you will most likely not need `ccache` on CI.

2. `ccache` relies on timestamps to compute a cache hit. This doesn't work well on CI as files are re-downloaded at every CI run. To overcome this, you'll need to use the `compiler_check content` option which relies instead on hashing the content of the file.

#### Distributed caches

Similar to local caches, you might want to consider using a distributed cache for your native builds. This could be specifically useful in bigger organizations that are doing frequent native builds.

We recommend to use sccache to achieve this. We defer to the sccache distributed compilation quickstart for instructions on how to setup and use this tool.

## Optimizing Flatlist Configuration

### Terms

- **VirtualizedList:** The component behind `FlatList` (React Native's implementation of the `Virtual List` concept.)

- **Memory consumption:** How much information about your list is being stored in memory, which could lead to an app crash.

- **Responsiveness:** Application ability to respond to interactions. Low responsiveness, for instance, is when you touch on a component and it waits a bit to respond, instead of responding immediately as expected.

- **Blank areas:** When `VirtualizedList` can't render your items fast enough, you may enter a part of your list with non-rendered components that appear as blank space.

- **Viewport:** The visible area of content that is rendered to pixels.

- **Window:** The area in which items should be mounted, which is generally much larger than the viewport.

### Props

Here are a list of props that can help to improve `FlatList` performance:

#### removeClippedSubviews

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| Boolean | False   |

If `true`, views that are outside of the viewport are detached from the native view hierarchy.

**Pros:** This reduces time spent on the main thread, and thus reduces the risk of dropped frames, by excluding views outside of the viewport from the native rendering and drawing traversals.

**Cons:** Be aware that this implementation can have bugs, such as missing content (mainly observed on iOS), especially if you are doing complex things with transforms and/or absolute positioning. Also note this does not save significant memory because the views are not deallocated, only detached.

#### maxToRenderPerBatch

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| Number | 10      |

It is a `VirtualizedList` prop that can be passed through `FlatList`. This controls the amount of items rendered per batch, which is the next chunk of items rendered on every scroll.

**Pros:** Setting a bigger number means less visual blank areas when scrolling (increases the fill rate).

**Cons:** More items per batch means longer periods of JavaScript execution potentially blocking other event processing, like presses, hurting responsiveness.

#### updateCellsBatchingPeriod

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| Number | 50      |

While `maxToRenderPerBatch` tells the amount of items rendered per batch, setting `updateCellsBatchingPeriod` tells your `VirtualizedList` the delay in milliseconds between batch renders (how frequently your component will be rendering the windowed items).

**Pros:** Combining this prop with `maxToRenderPerBatch` gives you the power to, for example, render more items in a less frequent batch, or less items in a more frequent batch.

**Cons:** Less frequent batches may cause blank areas, More frequent batches may cause responsiveness issues.

#### initialNumToRender

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| Number | 10      |

The initial amount of items to render.

**Pros:** Define precise number of items that would cover the screen for every device. This can be a big performance boost for the initial render.

**Cons:** Setting a low `initialNumToRender` may cause blank areas, especially if it's too small to cover the viewport on initial render.

#### windowSize

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| Number | 21      |

The number passed here is a measurement unit where 1 is equivalent to your viewport height. The default value is 21 (10 viewports above, 10 below, and one in between).

**Pros:** Bigger `windowSize` will result in less chance of seeing blank space while scrolling. On the other hand, smaller `windowSize` will result in fewer items mounted simultaneously, saving memory.

**Cons:** For a bigger `windowSize`, you will have more memory consumption. For a lower `windowSize`, you will have a bigger chance of seeing blank areas.

### List items

Below are some tips about list item components. They are the core of your list, so they need to be fast.

#### Use basic components

The more complex your components are, the slower they will render. Try to avoid a lot of logic and nesting in your list items. If you are reusing this list item component a lot in your app, create a component only for your big lists and make them with as little logic and nesting as possible.

#### Use light components

The heavier your components are, the slower they render. Avoid heavy images (use a cropped version or thumbnail for list items, as small as possible). Talk to your design team, use as little effects and interactions and information as possible in your list. Show them in your item's detail.

#### Use `memo()`

`React.memo()` creates a memoized component that will be re-rendered only when the props passed to the component change. We can use this function to optimize the components in the FlatList.

```
import React, {memo} from 'react';
import {View, Text} from 'react-native';

const MyListItem = memo(
  ({title}: {title: string}) => (
    <View>
      <Text>{title}</Text>
    </View>
  ),
  (prevProps, nextProps) => {
    return prevProps.title === nextProps.title;
  },
);

export default MyListItem;
```

In this example, we have determined that MyListItem should be re-rendered only when the title changes. We passed the comparison function as the second argument to React.memo() so that the component is re-rendered only when the specified prop is changed. If the comparison function returns true, the component will not be re-rendered.

#### Use cached optimized images

You can use the community packages (such as react-native-fast-image from @DylanVann) for more performant images. Every image in your list is a `new Image()` instance. The faster it reaches the `loaded` hook, the faster your JavaScript thread will be free again.

#### Use getItemLayout

If all your list item components have the same height (or width, for a horizontal list), providing the getItemLayout prop removes the need for your `FlatList` to manage async layout calculations. This is a very desirable optimization technique.

If your components have dynamic size and you really need performance, consider asking your design team if they may think of a redesign in order to perform better.

#### Use keyExtractor or key

You can set the `keyExtractor` to your `FlatList` component. This prop is used for caching and as the React `key` to track item re-ordering.

You can also use a `key` prop in your item component.

#### Avoid anonymous function on renderItem

For functional components, move the `renderItem` function outside of the returned JSX. Also, ensure that it is wrapped in a `useCallback` hook to prevent it from being recreated each render.

For class components, move the `renderItem` function outside of the render function, so it won't recreate itself each time the render function is called.

```
const renderItem = useCallback(({item}) => (
   <View key={item.key}>
      <Text>{item.title}</Text>
   </View>
 ), []);

return (
  // ...

  <FlatList data={items} renderItem={renderItem} />;
  // ...
);
```

## Optimizing JavaScript loading

Parsing and running JavaScript code requires memory and time. Because of this, as your app grows, it's often useful to delay loading code until it's needed for the first time. React Native comes with some standard optimizations that are on by default, and there are techniques you can adopt in your own code to help React load your app more efficiently. There are also some advanced automatic optimizations (with their own tradeoffs) that are suitable for very large apps.

### Recommended: Use Hermes

Hermes is the default engine for new React Native apps, and is highly optimized for efficient code loading. In release builds, JavaScript code is fully compiled to bytecode ahead of time. Bytecode is loaded to memory on-demand and does not need to be parsed like plain JavaScript does.

info

Read more about using Hermes in React Native here.

### Recommended: Lazy-load large components

If a component with a lot of code/dependencies is not likely to be used when initially rendering your app, you can use React's `lazy` API to defer loading its code until it's rendered for the first time. Typically, you should consider lazy-loading screen-level components in your app, so that adding new screens to your app does not increase its startup time.

info

#### Tip: Avoid module side effects

Lazy-loading components can change the behavior of your app if your component modules (or their dependencies) have _side effects_, such as modifying global variables or subscribing to events outside of a component. Most modules in React apps should not have any side effects.

SideEffects.tsx

```
import Logger from './utils/Logger';

//  🚩 🚩 🚩 Side effect! This must be executed before React can even begin to
// render the SplashScreen component, and can unexpectedly break code elsewhere
// in your app if you later decide to lazy-load SplashScreen.
global.logger = new Logger();

export function SplashScreen() {
  // ...
}
```

### Advanced: Call `require` inline

Sometimes you may want to defer loading some code until you use it for the first time, without using `lazy` or an asynchronous `import()`. You can do this by using the `require()` function where you would otherwise use a static `import` at the top of the file.

VeryExpensive.tsx

```
import {Component} from 'react';
import {Text} from 'react-native';
// ... import some very expensive modules

export default function VeryExpensive() {
  // ... lots and lots of rendering logic
  return <Text>Very Expensive Component</Text>;
}
```

Optimized.tsx

```
import {useCallback, useState} from 'react';
import {TouchableOpacity, View, Text} from 'react-native';
// Usually we would write a static import:
// import VeryExpensive from './VeryExpensive';

let VeryExpensive = null;

export default function Optimize() {
  const [needsExpensive, setNeedsExpensive] = useState(false);
  const didPress = useCallback(() => {
    if (VeryExpensive == null) {
      VeryExpensive = require('./VeryExpensive').default;
    }

    setNeedsExpensive(true);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={{marginTop: 20}}>
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={didPress}>
        <Text>Load</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
      {needsExpensive ? <VeryExpensive /> : null}
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Advanced: Automatically inline `require` calls

If you use the React Native CLI to build your app, `require` calls (but not `import`s) will automatically be inlined for you, both in your code and inside any third-party packages (`node_modules`) you use.

```
import {useCallback, useState} from 'react';
import {TouchableOpacity, View, Text} from 'react-native';

// This top-level require call will be evaluated lazily as part of the component below.
const VeryExpensive = require('./VeryExpensive').default;

export default function Optimize() {
  const [needsExpensive, setNeedsExpensive] = useState(false);
  const didPress = useCallback(() => {
    setNeedsExpensive(true);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={{marginTop: 20}}>
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={didPress}>
        <Text>Load</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
      {needsExpensive ? <VeryExpensive /> : null}
    </View>
  );
}
```

info

Some React Native frameworks disable this behavior. In particular, in Expo projects, `require` calls are not inlined by default. You can enable this optimization by editing your project's Metro config and setting `inlineRequires: true` in `getTransformOptions`.

#### Pitfalls of inline `require`s

Inlining `require` calls changes the order in which modules are evaluated, and can even cause some modules to _never_ be evaluated. This is usually safe to do automatically, because JavaScript modules are often written to be side-effect-free.

If one of your modules does have side effects - for example, if it initializes some logging mechanism, or patches a global API used by the rest of your code - then you might see unexpected behavior or even crashes. In those cases, you may want to exclude certain modules from this optimization, or disable it entirely.

To **disable all automatic inlining of `require` calls:**

Update your `metro.config.js` to set the `inlineRequires` transformer option to `false`:

metro.config.js

```
module.exports = {
  transformer: {
    async getTransformOptions() {
      return {
        transform: {
          inlineRequires: false,
        },
      };
    },
  },
};
```

To only **exclude certain modules from `require` inlining:**

There are two relevant transformer options: `inlineRequires.blockList` and `nonInlinedRequires`. See the code snippet for examples of how to use each one.

metro.config.js

```
module.exports = {
  transformer: {
    async getTransformOptions() {
      return {
        transform: {
          inlineRequires: {
            blockList: {
              // require() calls in `DoNotInlineHere.js` will not be inlined.
              [require.resolve('./src/DoNotInlineHere.js')]: true,

              // require() calls anywhere else will be inlined, unless they
              // match any entry nonInlinedRequires (see below).
            },
          },
          nonInlinedRequires: [
            // require('react') calls will not be inlined anywhere
            'react',
          ],
        },
      };
    },
  },
};
```

See the documentation for `getTransformOptions` in Metro for more details on setting up and fine-tuning your inline `require`s.

### Advanced: Use random access module bundles (non-Hermes)

info

**Not supported when using Hermes.** Hermes bytecode is not compatible with the RAM bundle format, and provides the same (or better) performance in all use cases.

Random access module bundles (also known as RAM bundles) work in conjunction with the techniques mentioned above to limit the amount of JavaScript code that needs to be parsed and loaded into memory. Each module is stored as a separate string (or file) which is only parsed when the module needs to be executed.

RAM bundles may be physically split into separate files, or they may use the _indexed_ format, consisting of a lookup table of multiple modules in a single file.

- Android
- iOS

On Android enable the RAM format by editing your `android/app/build.gradle` file. Before the line `apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native/react.gradle"` add or amend the `project.ext.react` block:

```
project.ext.react = [
  bundleCommand: "ram-bundle",
]
```

Use the following lines on Android if you want to use a single indexed file:

```
project.ext.react = [
  bundleCommand: "ram-bundle",
  extraPackagerArgs: ["--indexed-ram-bundle"]
]
```

On iOS, RAM bundles are always indexed ( = single file).

Enable the RAM format in Xcode by editing the build phase "Bundle React Native code and images". Before `../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh` add `export BUNDLE_COMMAND="ram-bundle"`:

```
export BUNDLE_COMMAND="ram-bundle"
export NODE_BINARY=node
../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh
```

See the documentation for `getTransformOptions` in Metro for more details on setting up and fine-tuning your RAM bundle build.

## Profiling

Profiling is the process of analyzing an app's performance, resource usage, and behavior to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies. It's worth making use of profiling tools to ensure your app works smoothly across different devices and conditions.

For iOS, Instruments is an invaluable tool, and on Android you should learn to use the Android Studio Profiler.

But first, **make sure that Development Mode is OFF!** You should see `__DEV__ === false, development-level warning are OFF, performance optimizations are ON` in your application logs.

### Profiling Android UI Performance with System Tracing

Android supports 10k+ different phones and is generalized to support software rendering: the framework architecture and need to generalize across many hardware targets unfortunately means you get less for free relative to iOS. But sometimes, there are things you can improve -- and many times it's not native code's fault at all!

The first step for debugging this jank is to answer the fundamental question of where your time is being spent during each 16ms frame. For that, we'll be using the built-in System Tracing profiler in the Android Studio.

#### 1. Collecting a trace

First, connect a device that exhibits the stuttering you want to investigate to your computer via USB. Open your project's `android` folder in Android Studio, select your device in the top right pane, and run your project as profileable.

When your app is built as profileable and is running on the device, get your app to the point right before the navigation/animation you want to profile and start the "Capture System Activities" task in the Android Studio Profiler pane.

Once the trace starts collecting, perform the animation or interaction you care about. Then press "Stop recording". You can now inspect the trace directly in the Android Studio. Alternatively, you can select it in the "Past Recordings" pane, press "Export recording", and open it in a tool like Perfetto.

#### 2. Reading the trace

After opening the trace in Android Studio or Perfetto, you should see something like this:

Hint

Use the WASD keys to strafe and zoom.

The exact UI might be different but the instructions below will apply regardless of the tool you're using.

Enable VSync highlighting

Check this checkbox at the top right of the screen to highlight the 16ms frame boundaries:

You should see zebra stripes as in the screenshot above. If you don't, try profiling on a different device: Samsung has been known to have issues displaying vsyncs while the Nexus series is generally pretty reliable.

#### 3. Find your process

Scroll until you see (part of) the name of your package. In this case, I was profiling `com.facebook.adsmanager`, which shows up as `book.adsmanager` because of silly thread name limits in the kernel.

On the left side, you'll see a set of threads which correspond to the timeline rows on the right. There are a few threads we care about for our purposes: the UI thread (which has your package name or the name UI Thread), `mqt_js`, and `mqt_native_modules`. If you're running on Android 5+, we also care about the Render Thread.

- **UI Thread.** This is where standard android measure/layout/draw happens. The thread name on the right will be your package name (in my case book.adsmanager) or UI Thread. The events that you see on this thread should look something like this and have to do with `Choreographer`, `traversals`, and `DispatchUI`:

- **JS Thread.** This is where JavaScript is executed. The thread name will be either `mqt_js` or `<...>` depending on how cooperative the kernel on your device is being. To identify it if it doesn't have a name, look for things like `JSCall`, `Bridge.executeJSCall`, etc:

- **Native Modules Thread.** This is where native module calls (e.g. the `UIManager`) are executed. The thread name will be either `mqt_native_modules` or `<...>`. To identify it in the latter case, look for things like `NativeCall`, `callJavaModuleMethod`, and `onBatchComplete`:

- **Bonus: Render Thread.** If you're using Android L (5.0) and up, you will also have a render thread in your application. This thread generates the actual OpenGL commands used to draw your UI. The thread name will be either `RenderThread` or `<...>`. To identify it in the latter case, look for things like `DrawFrame` and `queueBuffer`:

### Identifying a culprit

A smooth animation should look something like the following:

Each change in color is a frame -- remember that in order to display a frame, all our UI work needs to be done by the end of that 16ms period. Notice that no thread is working close to the frame boundary. An application rendering like this is rendering at 60 FPS.

If you noticed chop, however, you might see something like this:

Notice that the JS thread is executing almost all the time, and across frame boundaries! This app is not rendering at 60 FPS. In this case, **the problem lies in JS**.

You might also see something like this:

In this case, the UI and render threads are the ones that have work crossing frame boundaries. The UI that we're trying to render on each frame is requiring too much work to be done. In this case, **the problem lies in the native views being rendered**.

At this point, you'll have some very helpful information to inform your next steps.

### Resolving JavaScript issues

If you identified a JS problem, look for clues in the specific JS that you're executing. In the scenario above, we see `RCTEventEmitter` being called multiple times per frame. Here's a zoom-in of the JS thread from the trace above:

This doesn't seem right. Why is it being called so often? Are they actually different events? The answers to these questions will probably depend on your product code. And many times, you'll want to look into shouldComponentUpdate.

### Resolving native UI Issues

If you identified a native UI problem, there are usually two scenarios:

1. the UI you're trying to draw each frame involves too much work on the GPU, or
2. You're constructing new UI during the animation/interaction (e.g. loading in new content during a scroll).

#### Too much GPU work

In the first scenario, you'll see a trace that has the UI thread and/or Render Thread looking like this:

Notice the long amount of time spent in `DrawFrame` that crosses frame boundaries. This is time spent waiting for the GPU to drain its command buffer from the previous frame.

To mitigate this, you should:

- investigate using `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid` for complex, static content that is being animated/transformed (e.g. the `Navigator` slide/alpha animations)
- make sure that you are **not** using `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`, which is disabled by default, as it greatly increases the per-frame load on the GPU in most cases.

#### Creating new views on the UI thread

In the second scenario, you'll see something more like this:

Notice that first the JS thread thinks for a bit, then you see some work done on the native modules thread, followed by an expensive traversal on the UI thread.

There isn't a quick way to mitigate this unless you're able to postpone creating new UI until after the interaction, or you are able to simplify the UI you're creating. The react native team is working on an infrastructure level solution for this that will allow new UI to be created and configured off the main thread, allowing the interaction to continue smoothly.

#### Finding native CPU hotspots

If the problem seems to be on the native side, you can use the CPU hotspot profiler to get more details on what's happening. Open the Android Studio Profiler panel and select "Find CPU Hotspots (Java/Kotlin Method Recording)".

Choose the Java/Kotlin recording

Make sure you select "Find CPU Hotspots **(Java/Kotlin Recording)**" rather than "Find CPU Hotspots (Callstack Sample)". They have similar icons but do different things.

Perform the interactions and press "Stop recording". Recording is resource-intensive, so keep the interaction short. You can then either inspect the resulting trace in the Android Studio or export it and open it in an online tool like Firefox Profiler.

Unlike System Trace, CPU hotspot profiling is slow so it won't give you accurate measurements. However, it should give you an idea of what native methods are being called, and where the time is being spent proportionally during each frame.

## Timers

Timers are an important part of an application and React Native implements the browser timers.

### Timers

- setTimeout, clearTimeout
- setInterval, clearInterval
- setImmediate, clearImmediate
- requestAnimationFrame, cancelAnimationFrame

`requestAnimationFrame(fn)` is not the same as `setTimeout(fn, 0)` - the former will fire after all the frames have flushed, whereas the latter will fire as quickly as possible (over 1000x per second on a iPhone 5S).

`setImmediate` is executed at the end of the current JavaScript execution block, right before sending the batched response back to native. Note that if you call `setImmediate` within a `setImmediate` callback, it will be executed right away, it won't yield back to native in between.

The `Promise` implementation uses `setImmediate` as its asynchronicity implementation.

note

When debugging on Android, if the times between the debugger and device have drifted; things such as animation, event behavior, etc., might not work properly or the results may not be accurate. Please correct this by running ``adb shell "date `date +%m%d%H%M%Y.%S%3N`"`` on your debugger machine. Root access is required for the use in real device.

### InteractionManager

One reason why well-built native apps feel so smooth is by avoiding expensive operations during interactions and animations. In React Native, we currently have a limitation that there is only a single JS execution thread, but you can use `InteractionManager` to make sure long-running work is scheduled to start after any interactions/animations have completed.

Applications can schedule tasks to run after interactions with the following:

```
InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() => {
  // ...long-running synchronous task...
});
```

Compare this to other scheduling alternatives:

- requestAnimationFrame(): for code that animates a view over time.
- setImmediate/setTimeout/setInterval(): run code later, note this may delay animations.
- runAfterInteractions(): run code later, without delaying active animations.

The touch handling system considers one or more active touches to be an 'interaction' and will delay `runAfterInteractions()` callbacks until all touches have ended or been cancelled.

InteractionManager also allows applications to register animations by creating an interaction 'handle' on animation start, and clearing it upon completion:

```
const handle = InteractionManager.createInteractionHandle();
// run animation... (`runAfterInteractions` tasks are queued)
// later, on animation completion:
InteractionManager.clearInteractionHandle(handle);
// queued tasks run if all handles were cleared
```

## Using Hermes

Hermes is an open-source JavaScript engine optimized for React Native. For many apps, using Hermes will result in improved start-up time, decreased memory usage, and smaller app size when compared to JavaScriptCore. Hermes is used by default by React Native and no additional configuration is required to enable it.

### Bundled Hermes

React Native comes with a **bundled version** of Hermes. We are building a version of Hermes for you whenever we release a new version of React Native. This will make sure you're consuming a version of Hermes which is fully compatible with the version of React Native you're using.

This change is fully transparent to users of React Native. You can still disable Hermes using the command described in this page. You can read more about the technical implementation on this page.

### Confirming Hermes is in use

If you've recently created a new app from scratch, you should see if Hermes is enabled in the welcome view:

A `HermesInternal` global variable will be available in JavaScript that can be used to verify that Hermes is in use:

jsx

```
const isHermes = () => !!global.HermesInternal;
```

caution

If you are using a non-standard way of loading the JS bundle, it is possible that the `HermesInternal` variable is available but you aren't using the highly optimised pre-compiled bytecode. Confirm that you are using the `.hbc` file and also benchmark the before/after as detailed below.

To see the benefits of Hermes, try making a release build/deployment of your app to compare. For example; from the root of your project:

- Android
- iOS

* npm
* Yarn

shell

```
npm run android -- --mode="release"
```

shell

```
yarn android --mode release
```

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm run ios -- --mode="Release"
```

shell

```
yarn ios --mode Release
```

This will compile JavaScript to Hermes Bytecode during build time which will improve your app's startup speed on device.

### Switching back to JavaScriptCore

React Native also supports using JavaScriptCore as the JavaScript engine. Follow these instructions to opt-out of Hermes.

#### Android

Edit your `android/gradle.properties` file and flip `hermesEnabled` back to false:

diff

```
# Use this property to enable or disable the Hermes JS engine.
# If set to false, you will be using JSC instead.
hermesEnabled=false
```

#### iOS

Edit your `ios/Podfile` file and make the change illustrated below:

diff

```
   use_react_native!(
     :path => config[:reactNativePath],
+    :hermes_enabled => false,
     # An absolute path to your application root.
     :app_path => "#{Pod::Config.instance.installation_root}/.."
   )
```

## What is Codegen?

**Codegen** is a tool to avoid writing a lot of repetitive code. Using Codegen **is not mandatory**: you can write all the generated manually. However, **Codegen** generates scaffolding code that could save you a lot of time.

React Native invokes **Codegen** automatically every time an iOS or Android app is built. Occasionally, you would like to manually run the **Codegen** scripts to know which types and files are actually generated: this is a common scenario when developing Turbo Native Modules and Fabric Native Components.

### How does Codegen works

**Codegen** is a process that is tightly coupled with a React Native app. The **Codegen** scripts live inside the `react-native` NPM package and the apps call those scripts at build time.

**Codegen** crawls the folders in your project, starting from a directory you specify in your `package.json`, looking for some specific JS files that contains the specification (or specs) for your custom modules and components. Spec files are JS files written in a typed dialect: React Native currently supports Flow and TypeScript.

Every time **Codegen** finds a spec file, it generates the boilerplate code associated to it. **Codegen** generates some C++ glue-code and then it generates platform-specific code, using Java for Android and Objective-C++ for iOS.

## Using Codegen

This guide teaches how to:

- Configure **Codegen**.
- Invoke it manually for each platform.

It also describes the generated code.

### Prerequisites

You always need a React Native app to generate the code properly, even when invoking the **Codegen** manually.

The **Codegen** process is tightly coupled with the build of the app, and the scripts are located in the `react-native` NPM package.

For the sake of this guide, create a project using the React Native CLI as follows:

bash

```
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init SampleApp --version 0.76.0
```

**Codegen** is used to generate the glue-code for your custom modules or components. See the guides for Turbo Native Modules and Fabric Native Components for more details on how to create them.

### Configuring **Codegen**

**Codegen** can be configured in your app by modifying the `package.json` file. **Codegen** is controlled by a custom field called `codegenConfig`.

package.json

```
  "codegenConfig": {
    "name": "<SpecName>",
    "type": "<types>",
    "jsSrcsDir": "<source_dir>",
    "android": {
      "javaPackageName": "<java.package.name>"
    },
    "ios": {
      "modulesConformingToProtocol": {
        "RCTImageURLLoader": [
          "<iOS-class-conforming-to-RCTImageURLLoader>",
          // example from react-native-camera-roll: https://github.com/react-native-cameraroll/react-native-cameraroll/blob/8a6d1b4279c76e5682a4b443e7a4e111e774ec0a/package.json#L118-L127
          // "RNCPHAssetLoader",
        ],
        "RCTURLRequestHandler": [
          "<iOS-class-conforming-to-RCTURLRequestHandler>",
          // example from react-native-camera-roll: https://github.com/react-native-cameraroll/react-native-cameraroll/blob/8a6d1b4279c76e5682a4b443e7a4e111e774ec0a/package.json#L118-L127
          // "RNCPHAssetUploader",
        ],
        "RCTImageDataDecoder": [
          "<iOS-class-conforming-to-RCTImageDataDecoder>",
          // we don't have a good example for this, but it works in the same way. Pass the name of the class that implements the RCTImageDataDecoder. It must be a Native Module.
        ]
      },
      "componentProvider": {
        "<componentName>": "<iOS-class-implementing-the-component>"
      },
      "modulesProvider": {
        "<moduleName>": "<iOS-class-implementing-the-RCTModuleProvider-protocol>"
      }
    }
  },
```

You can add this snippet to your app and customize the various fields:

- `name:` This is the name that will be used to create files containing your specs. As a convention, It should have the suffix `Spec`, but this is not mandatory.

- `type`: the type of code we need to generate. Allowed values are `modules`, `components`, `all`.

  - `modules:` use this value if you only need to generate code for Turbo Native Modules.
  - `components:` use this value if you only need to generate code for Native Fabric Components.
  - `all`: use this value if you have a mixture of components and modules.

- `jsSrcsDir`: this is the root folder where all your specs live.

- `android.javaPackageName`: this is an Android specific setting to let **Codegen** generate the files in a custom package.

- `ios`: the `ios` field is an object that can be used by app developers and library maintainers to provide some advanced functionalities. All the following fields are **optional**.

  - `ios.modulesConformingToProtocol`: React Native offers some protocols that native modules can implement to customize some behaviors. These fields allow you to define the list of module that conforms to those protocols. These modules will be injected in the React Native runtime when the app starts.

    - `ios.modulesConformingToProtocol.RCTImageURLLoader`: list of iOS native module that implements the `RCTImageURLLoader` protocol. You need to pass the class names of iOS classes that implements the `RCTImageURLLoader`. They must be Native Modules.
    - `ios.modulesConformingToProtocol.RCTURLRequestHandler`: list of iOS native module that implements the `RCTURLRequestHandler` protocol. You need to pass the class names of iOS classes that implements the `RCTURLRequestHandler`. They must be Native Modules.
    - `ios.modulesConformingToProtocol.RCTImageDataDecoder`: list of iOS native module that implements the `RCTImageDataDecoder` protocol. You need to pass the class names of iOS classes that implements the `RCTImageDataDecoder`. They must be Native Modules.

  - `ios.componentProvider`: this field is a map used to generate the association between a custom JS React component and the native class that implements it. The key of the map is the JS name of the component (for example `TextInput`), and the value is the iOS class that implements the component (for example `RCTTextInput`).

  - `ios.modulesProvider`: this field is a map used to generate the association between a custom JS Native Module and the native class that can provide it. The key of the map is the JS name of the module (for example `NativeLocalStorage`), and the value is the iOS class that implements the `RCTModuleProvider` protocol. For Objective-C modules, the class implementing the `RCTTurboModule` protocol is also implementing the `RCTModuleProvider` protocol. For more information, looks at the Cross-Platform Native Modules (C++) guide.

When **Codegen** runs, it searches among all the dependencies of the app, looking for JS files that respects some specific conventions, and it generates the required code:

- Turbo Native Modules require that the spec files are prefixed with `Native`. For example, `NativeLocalStorage.ts` is a valid name for a spec file.
- Native Fabric Components require that the spec files are suffixed with `NativeComponent`. For example, `WebViewNativeComponent.ts` is a valid name for a spec file.

### Running **Codegen**

The rest of this guide assumes that you have a Native Turbo Module, a Native Fabric Component or both already set up in your project. We also assume that you have valid specification files in the `jsSrcsDir` specified in the `package.json`.

#### Android

**Codegen** for Android is integrated with the React Native Gradle Plugin (RNGP). The RNGP contains a task that can be invoked that reads the configurations defined in the `package.json` file and execute **Codegen**. To run the gradle task, first navigate inside the `android` folder of your project. Then run:

bash

```
./gradlew generateCodegenArtifactsFromSchema
```

This task invokes the `generateCodegenArtifactsFromSchema` command on all the imported projects of the app (the app and all the node modules which are linked to it). It generates the code in the corresponding `node_modules/<dependency>` folder. For example, if you have a Fabric Native Component whose Node module is called `my-fabric-component`, the generated code is located in the `SampleApp/node_modules/my-fabric-component/android/build/generated/source/codegen` path. For the app, the code is generated in the `android/app/build/generated/source/codegen` folder.

##### The Generated Code

After running the gradle command above, you will find the codegen code in the `SampleApp/android/app/build` folder. The structure will look like this:

```
build
└── generated
    └── source
        └── codegen
            ├── java
            │   └── com

            │       └── sampleapp
            │           └── NativeLocalStorageSpec.java
            ├── jni
            │   ├── <codegenConfig.name>-generated.cpp
            │   ├── <codegenConfig.name>.h
            │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
            │   └── react
            │       └── renderer
            │           └── components
            │               └── <codegenConfig.name>
            │                   ├── <codegenConfig.name>JSI-generated.cpp
            │                   ├── <codegenConfig.name>.h
            │                   ├── ComponentDescriptors.cpp
            │                   ├── ComponentDescriptors.h
            │                   ├── EventEmitters.cpp
            │                   ├── EventEmitters.h
            │                   ├── Props.cpp
            │                   ├── Props.h
            │                   ├── ShadowNodes.cpp
            │                   ├── ShadowNodes.h
            │                   ├── States.cpp
            │                   └── States.h
            └── schema.json
```

The generated code is split in two folders:

- `java` which contains the platform specific code
- `jni` which contains the C++ code required to let JS and Java interact correctly.

In the `java` folder, you can find the Fabric Native component generated code in the `com/facebook/viewmanagers` subfolder.

- the `<nativeComponent>ManagerDelegate.java` contains the methods that the `ViewManager` can call on the custom Native Component
- the `<nativeComponent>ManagerInterface.java` contains the interface of the `ViewManager`.

In the folder whose name was set up in the `codegenConfig.android.javaPackageName`, instead, you can find the abstract class that a Turbo Native Module has to implement to carry out its tasks.

In the `jni` folder, finally, there is all the boilerplate code to connect JS to Android.

- `<codegenConfig.name>.h` this contains the interface of your custom C++ Turbo Native Modules.
- `<codegenConfig.name>-generated.cpp` this contains the glue code of your custom C++ Turbo Native Modules.
- `react/renderer/components/<codegenConfig.name>`: this folder contains all the glue-code required by your custom component.

This structure has been generated by using the value `all` for the `codegenConfig.type` field. If you use the value `modules`, expect to see no `react/renderer/components/` folder. If you use the value `components`, expect not to see any of the other files.

#### iOS

**Codegen** for iOS relies on some Node scripts that are invoked during the build process. The scripts are located in the `SampleApp/node_modules/react-native/scripts/` folder.

The main script is the `generate-codegen-artifacts.js` script. To invoke the script, you can run this command from the root folder of your app:

bash

```
node node_modules/react-native/scripts/generate-codegen-artifacts.js

Usage: generate-codegen-artifacts.js -p [path to app] -t [target platform] -o [output path]

Options:
      --help            Show help                                      [boolean]
      --version         Show version number                            [boolean]
  -p, --path            Path to the React Native project root.        [required]
  -t, --targetPlatform  Target platform. Supported values: "android", "ios",
                        "all".                                        [required]
  -o, --outputPath      Path where generated artifacts will be output to.
```

where:

- `--path` is the path to the root folder of your app.
- `--outputPath` is the destination where **Codegen** will write the generated files.
- `--targetPlatform` is the platform you'd like to generate the code for.

##### The Generated Code

Running the script with these arguments:

shell

```
node node_modules/react-native/scripts/generate-codegen-artifacts.js \
    --path . \
    --outputPath ios/ \
    --targetPlatform ios
```

Will generate these files in the `ios/build` folder:

```
build
└── generated
    └── ios
        ├── <codegenConfig.name>
        │   ├── <codegenConfig.name>-generated.mm
        │   └── <codegenConfig.name>.h
        ├── <codegenConfig.name>JSI-generated.cpp
        ├── <codegenConfig.name>JSI.h
        ├── FBReactNativeSpec
        │   ├── FBReactNativeSpec-generated.mm
        │   └── FBReactNativeSpec.h
        ├── FBReactNativeSpecJSI-generated.cpp
        ├── FBReactNativeSpecJSI.h
        ├── RCTModulesConformingToProtocolsProvider.h
        ├── RCTModulesConformingToProtocolsProvider.mm
        └── react
            └── renderer
                └── components
                    └── <codegenConfig.name>
                        ├── ComponentDescriptors.cpp
                        ├── ComponentDescriptors.h
                        ├── EventEmitters.cpp
                        ├── EventEmitters.h
                        ├── Props.cpp
                        ├── Props.h
                        ├── RCTComponentViewHelpers.h
                        ├── ShadowNodes.cpp
                        ├── ShadowNodes.h
                        ├── States.cpp
                        └── States.h
```

Part of these generated files are used by React Native in the Core. Then there is a set of files which contains the same name you specified in the package.json `codegenConfig.name` field.

- `<codegenConfig.name>/<codegenConfig.name>.h`: this contains the interface of your custom iOS Turbo Native Modules.
- `<codegenConfig.name>/<codegenConfig.name>-generated.mm`: this contains the glue code of your custom iOS Turbo Native Modules.
- `<codegenConfig.name>JSI.h`: this contains the interface of your custom C++ Turbo Native Modules.
- `<codegenConfig.name>JSI-generated.h`: this contains the glue code of your custom C++ Turbo Native Modules.
- `react/renderer/components/<codegenConfig.name>`: this folder contains all the glue-code required by your custom component.

This structure has been generated by using the value `all` for the `codegenConfig.type` field. If you use the value `modules`, expect to see no `react/renderer/components/` folder. If you use the value `components`, expect not to see any of the other files.

## The Codegen CLI

Calling Gradle or manually calling a script might be hard to remember and it requires a lot of ceremony.

To simplify it, we created a CLI tool that can help you running those tasks: the **Codegen** cli. This command runs @react-native/codegen for your project. The following options are available:

sh

```
npx @react-native-community/cli codegen --help
Usage: rnc-cli codegen [options]

Options:
  --verbose            Increase logging verbosity
  --path <path>        Path to the React Native project root. (default: "/Users/MyUsername/projects/my-app")
  --platform <string>  Target platform. Supported values: "android", "ios", "all". (default: "all")
  --outputPath <path>  Path where generated artifacts will be output to.
  -h, --help           display help for command
```

### Examples

- Read `package.json` from the current working directory, generate code based on its codegenConfig.

shell

```
npx @react-native-community/cli codegen
```

- Read `package.json` from the current working directory, generate iOS code in the location defined in the codegenConfig.

shell

```
npx @react-native-community/cli codegen --platform ios
```

- Read `package.json` from `third-party/some-library`, generate Android code in `third-party/some-library/android/generated`.

shell

```
npx @react-native-community/cli codegen \
    --path third-party/some-library \
    --platform android \
    --outputPath third-party/some-library/android/generated
```

### Including Generated Code into Libraries

The Codegen CLI is a great tool for library developers. It can be used to take a sneak-peek at the generated code to see which interfaces you need to implement.

Normally the generated code is not included in the library, and the app that uses the library is responsible for running the Codegen at build time. This is a good setup for most cases, but Codegen also offers a mechanism to include the generated code in the library itself via the `includesGeneratedCode` property.

It's important to understand what are the implications of using `includesGeneratedCode = true`. Including the generated code comes with several benefits such as:

- No need to rely on the app to run **Codegen** for you, the generated code is always there.
- The implementation files are always consistent with the generated interfaces (this makes your library code more resilient against API changes in codegen).
- No need to include two sets of files to support both architectures on Android. You can only keep the New Architecture one, and it is guaranteed to be backwards compatible.
- Since all native code is there, it is possible to ship the native part of the library as a prebuild.

On the other hand, you also need to be aware of one drawback:

- The generated code will use the React Native version defined inside your library. So if your library is shipping with React Native 0.76, the generated code will be based on that version. This could mean that the generated code is not compatible with apps using **previous** React Native version used by the app (e.g. an App running on React Native 0.75).

### Enabling `includesGeneratedCode`

To enable this setup:

- Add the `includesGeneratedCode` property into your library's `codegenConfig` field in the `package.json` file. Set its value to `true`.

- Run **Codegen** locally with the codegen CLI.

- Update your `package.json` to include the generated code.

- Update your `podspec` to include the generated code.

- Update your `build.Gradle` file to include the generated code.

- Update `cmakeListsPath` in `react-native.config.js` so that Gradle doesn't look for CMakeLists file in the build directory but instead in your outputDir.

## Native Platform

Your application may need access to platform features that aren’t directly available from react-native or one of the hundreds of third-party libraries maintained by the community. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift, Java, Kotlin or C++ code from the JavaScript runtime. Whatever your reason, React Native exposes a powerful set of API to connect your native code to your JavaScript application code.

This guide introduces:

- **Native Modules:** native libraries that have no User Interface (UI) for the user. Examples would be persistent storage, notifications, network events. These are accessible to your user as JavaScript functions and objects.
- **Native Component:** native platform views, widgets and controllers that are available to your application's JavaScript code through React Components.

note

You might have previously been familiar with:

- Legacy Native Modules;
- Legacy Native Components;

These are our deprecated native module and component API. You can still use many of these legacy libraries with the New Architecture thanks to our interop layers. You should consider:

- using alternative libraries,
- upgrading to newer library versions that have first-class support for the New Architecture, or
- port these libraries yourself to Turbo Native Modules or Fabric Native Components.

2. Fabric Native Components \*

## Native Modules

Your React Native application code may need to interact with native platform APIs that aren't provided by React Native or an existing library. You can write the integration code yourself using a **Turbo Native Module**. This guide will show you how to write one.

The basic steps are:

1. **define a typed JavaScript specification** using one of the most popular JavaScript type annotation languages: Flow or TypeScript;
2. **configure your dependency management system to run Codegen**, which converts the specification into native language interfaces;
3. **write your application code** using your specification; and
4. **write your native platform code using the generated interfaces** to write and hook your native code into the React Native runtime environment.

Lets work through each of these steps by building an example Turbo Native Module. The rest of this guide assume that you have created your application running the command:

shell

```
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init TurboModuleExample --version 0.76.0
```

### Native Persistent Storage

This guide will show you how to write an implementation of the Web Storage API: `localStorage`. The API is relatable to a React developer who might be writing application code on your project.

To make this work on mobile, we need to use Android and iOS APIs:

- Android: SharedPreferences, and
- iOS: NSUserDefaults.

#### 1. Declare Typed Specification

React Native provides a tool called Codegen, which takes a specification written in TypeScript or Flow and generates platform specific code for Android and iOS. The specification declares the methods and data types that will pass back and forth between your native code and the React Native JavaScript runtime. A Turbo Native Module is both your specification, the native code you write, and the Codegen interfaces generated from your specification.

To create a specs file:

1. Inside the root folder of your app, create a new folder called `specs`.
2. Create a new file called `NativeLocalStorage.ts`.

info

You can see all of the types you can use in your specification and the native types that are generated in the Appendix documentation.

Here is an implementation of the `localStorage` specification:

- TypeScript
- Flow

specs/NativeLocalStorage.ts

```
import type {TurboModule} from 'react-native';
import {TurboModuleRegistry} from 'react-native';

export interface Spec extends TurboModule {
  setItem(value: string, key: string): void;
  getItem(key: string): string | null;
  removeItem(key: string): void;
  clear(): void;
}

export default TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing<Spec>(
  'NativeLocalStorage',
);
```

NativeLocalStorage.js

```
import type {TurboModule} from 'react-native';
import {TurboModule, TurboModuleRegistry} from 'react-native';

export interface Spec extends TurboModule {
  setItem(value: string, key: string): void;
  getItem(key: string): ?string;
  removeItem(key: string): void;
  clear(): void;
}
```

#### 2. Configure Codegen to run

The specification is used by the React Native Codegen tools to generate platform specific interfaces and boilerplate for us. To do this, Codegen needs to know where to find our specification and what to do with it. Update your `package.json` to include:

package.json

```
     "start": "react-native start",
     "test": "jest"
   },
   "codegenConfig": {
     "name": "NativeLocalStorageSpec",
     "type": "modules",
     "jsSrcsDir": "specs",
     "android": {
       "javaPackageName": "com.nativelocalstorage"
     }
   },
   "dependencies": {
```

With everything wired up for Codegen, we need to prepare our native code to hook into our generated code.

- Android
- iOS

Codegen is executed through the `generateCodegenArtifactsFromSchema` Gradle task:

bash

```
cd android
./gradlew generateCodegenArtifactsFromSchema

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 837ms
14 actionable tasks: 3 executed, 11 up-to-date
```

This is automatically run when you build your Android application.

Codegen is run as part of the script phases that's automatically added to the project generated by CocoaPods.

bash

```
cd ios
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

The output will look like this:

shell

```
...
Framework build type is static library
[Codegen] Adding script_phases to ReactCodegen.
[Codegen] Generating ./build/generated/ios/ReactCodegen.podspec.json

[Codegen] Searching for codegen-enabled libraries in the app.
[Codegen] Found TurboModuleExample
[Codegen] Searching for codegen-enabled libraries in the project dependencies.
[Codegen] Found react-native
...
```

#### 3. Write Application Code using the Turbo Native Module

Using `NativeLocalStorage`, here’s a modified `App.tsx` that includes some text we want persisted, an input field and some buttons to update this value.

The `TurboModuleRegistry` supports 2 modes of retrieving a Turbo Native Module:

- `get<T>(name: string): T | null` which will return `null` if the Turbo Native Module is unavailable.
- `getEnforcing<T>(name: string): T` which will throw an exception if the Turbo Native Module is unavailable. This assumes the module is always available.

App.tsx

```
import React from 'react';
import {
  SafeAreaView,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  TextInput,
  Button,
} from 'react-native';

import NativeLocalStorage from './specs/NativeLocalStorage';

const EMPTY = '<empty>';

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState<string | null>(null);

  const [editingValue, setEditingValue] = React.useState<
    string | null
  >(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const storedValue = NativeLocalStorage?.getItem('myKey');
    setValue(storedValue ?? '');
  }, []);

  function saveValue() {
    NativeLocalStorage?.setItem(editingValue ?? EMPTY, 'myKey');
    setValue(editingValue);
  }

  function clearAll() {
    NativeLocalStorage?.clear();
    setValue('');
  }

  function deleteValue() {
    NativeLocalStorage?.removeItem('myKey');
    setValue('');
  }

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={{flex: 1}}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        Current stored value is: {value ?? 'No Value'}
      </Text>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter the text you want to store"
        style={styles.textInput}
        onChangeText={setEditingValue}
      />
      <Button title="Save" onPress={saveValue} />
      <Button title="Delete" onPress={deleteValue} />
      <Button title="Clear" onPress={clearAll} />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  text: {
    margin: 10,
    fontSize: 20,
  },
  textInput: {
    margin: 10,
    height: 40,
    borderColor: 'black',
    borderWidth: 1,
    paddingLeft: 5,
    paddingRight: 5,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

#### 4. Write your Native Platform code

With everything prepared, we're going to start writing native platform code. We do this in 2 parts:

note

This guide shows you how to create a Turbo Native Module that only works with the New Architecture. If you need to support both the New Architecture and the Legacy Architecture, please refer to our backwards compatibility guide.

- Android
- iOS

Now it's time to write some Android platform code to make sure `localStorage` survives after the application is closed.

The first step is to implement the generated `NativeLocalStorageSpec` interface:

- Java
- Kotlin

android/app/src/main/java/com/nativelocalstorage/NativeLocalStorageModule.java

```
package com.nativelocalstorage;

import android.content.Context;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import com.nativelocalstorage.NativeLocalStorageSpec;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;

public class NativeLocalStorageModule extends NativeLocalStorageSpec {

  public static final String NAME = "NativeLocalStorage";

  public NativeLocalStorageModule(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {
    super(reactContext);
  }

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return NAME;
  }

  @Override
  public void setItem(String value, String key) {
    SharedPreferences sharedPref = getReactApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences("my_prefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
    SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPref.edit();
    editor.putString(key, value);
    editor.apply();
  }

  @Override
  public String getItem(String key) {
    SharedPreferences sharedPref = getReactApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences("my_prefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
    String username = sharedPref.getString(key, null);
    return username;
  }

  @Override
  public void removeItem(String key) {
    SharedPreferences sharedPref = getReactApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences("my_prefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
    sharedPref.edit().remove(key).apply();
  }
}
```

android/app/src/main/java/com/nativelocalstorage/NativeLocalStorageModule.kt

```
package com.nativelocalstorage

import android.content.Context
import android.content.SharedPreferences
import com.nativelocalstorage.NativeLocalStorageSpec
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext

class NativeLocalStorageModule(reactContext: ReactApplicationContext) : NativeLocalStorageSpec(reactContext) {

  override fun getName() = NAME

  override fun setItem(value: String, key: String) {
    val sharedPref = getReactApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences("my_prefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
    val editor = sharedPref.edit()
    editor.putString(key, value)
    editor.apply()
  }

  override fun getItem(key: String): String? {
    val sharedPref = getReactApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences("my_prefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
    val username = sharedPref.getString(key, null)
    return username.toString()
  }

  override fun removeItem(key: String) {
    val sharedPref = getReactApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences("my_prefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
    val editor = sharedPref.edit()
    editor.remove(key)
    editor.apply()
  }

  override fun clear() {
    val sharedPref = getReactApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences("my_prefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
    val editor = sharedPref.edit()
    editor.clear()
    editor.apply()
  }

  companion object {
    const val NAME = "NativeLocalStorage"
  }
}
```

Next we need to create `NativeLocalStoragePackage`. It provides an object to register our Module in the React Native runtime, by wrapping it as a Base Native Package:

- Java
- Kotlin

android/app/src/main/java/com/nativelocalstorage/NativeLocalStoragePackage.java

```
package com.nativelocalstorage;

import com.facebook.react.BaseReactPackage;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;
import com.facebook.react.module.model.ReactModuleInfo;
import com.facebook.react.module.model.ReactModuleInfoProvider;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class NativeLocalStoragePackage extends BaseReactPackage {

  @Override
  public NativeModule getModule(String name, ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {
    if (name.equals(NativeLocalStorageModule.NAME)) {
      return new NativeLocalStorageModule(reactContext);
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }

  @Override
  public ReactModuleInfoProvider getReactModuleInfoProvider() {
    return new ReactModuleInfoProvider() {
      @Override
      public Map<String, ReactModuleInfo> getReactModuleInfos() {
        Map<String, ReactModuleInfo> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(NativeLocalStorageModule.NAME, new ReactModuleInfo(
          NativeLocalStorageModule.NAME,       // name
          NativeLocalStorageModule.NAME,       // className
          false, // canOverrideExistingModule
          false, // needsEagerInit
          false, // isCXXModule
          true   // isTurboModule
        ));
        return map;
      }
    };
  }
}
```

android/app/src/main/java/com/nativelocalstorage/NativeLocalStoragePackage.kt

```
package com.nativelocalstorage

import com.facebook.react.BaseReactPackage
import com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext
import com.facebook.react.module.model.ReactModuleInfo
import com.facebook.react.module.model.ReactModuleInfoProvider

class NativeLocalStoragePackage : BaseReactPackage() {

  override fun getModule(name: String, reactContext: ReactApplicationContext): NativeModule? =
    if (name == NativeLocalStorageModule.NAME) {
      NativeLocalStorageModule(reactContext)
    } else {
      null
    }

  override fun getReactModuleInfoProvider() = ReactModuleInfoProvider {
    mapOf(
      NativeLocalStorageModule.NAME to ReactModuleInfo(
        name = NativeLocalStorageModule.NAME,
        className = NativeLocalStorageModule.NAME,
        canOverrideExistingModule = false,
        needsEagerInit = false,
        isCxxModule = false,
        isTurboModule = true
      )
    )
  }
}
```

Finally, we need to tell the React Native in our main application how to find this `Package`. We call this "registering" the package in React Native.

In this case, you add it to be returned by the getPackages method.

info

Later you’ll learn how to distribute your Native Modules as npm packages, which our build tooling will autolink for you.

- Java
- Kotlin

android/app/src/main/java/com/turobmoduleexample/MainApplication.java

```
package com.inappmodule;

import android.app.Application;
import com.facebook.react.PackageList;
import com.facebook.react.ReactApplication;
import com.facebook.react.ReactHost;
import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost;
import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage;
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint;
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactHost;
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactNativeHost;
import com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader;
import com.nativelocalstorage.NativeLocalStoragePackage;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

  private final ReactNativeHost reactNativeHost = new DefaultReactNativeHost(this) {
    @Override
    public List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      List<ReactPackage> packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
      // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
      // packages.add(new MyReactNativePackage());
      packages.add(new NativeLocalStoragePackage());
      return packages;
    }

    @Override
    public String getJSMainModuleName() {
      return "index";
    }

    @Override
    public boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {
      return BuildConfig.DEBUG;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isNewArchEnabled() {
      return BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isHermesEnabled() {
      return BuildConfig.IS_HERMES_ENABLED;
    }
  };

  @Override
  public ReactHost getReactHost() {
    return DefaultReactHost.getDefaultReactHost(getApplicationContext(), reactNativeHost);
  }

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    SoLoader.init(this, false);
    if (BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED) {
      // If you opted-in for the New Architecture, we load the native entry point for this app.
      DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.load();
    }
  }
}
```

android/app/src/main/java/com/turobmoduleexample/MainApplication.kt

```
package com.inappmodule

import android.app.Application
import com.facebook.react.PackageList
import com.facebook.react.ReactApplication
import com.facebook.react.ReactHost
import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost
import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.load
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactHost.getDefaultReactHost
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactNativeHost
import com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader
import com.nativelocalstorage.NativeLocalStoragePackage

class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {

  override val reactNativeHost: ReactNativeHost =
      object : DefaultReactNativeHost(this) {
        override fun getPackages(): List<ReactPackage> =
            PackageList(this).packages.apply {
              // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
              // add(MyReactNativePackage())
              add(NativeLocalStoragePackage())
            }

        override fun getJSMainModuleName(): String = "index"

        override fun getUseDeveloperSupport(): Boolean = BuildConfig.DEBUG

        override val isNewArchEnabled: Boolean = BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED
        override val isHermesEnabled: Boolean = BuildConfig.IS_HERMES_ENABLED
      }

  override val reactHost: ReactHost
    get() = getDefaultReactHost(applicationContext, reactNativeHost)

  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    SoLoader.init(this, false)
    if (BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED) {
      // If you opted-in for the New Architecture, we load the native entry point for this app.
      load()
    }
  }
}
```

You can now build and run your code on an emulator:

- npm
- Yarn

bash

```
npm run android
```

bash

```
yarn run android
```

Now it's time to write some iOS platform code to make sure `localStorage` survives after the application is closed.

### Prepare your Xcode Project

We need to prepare your iOS project using Xcode. After completing these **6 steps** you'll have `RCTNativeLocalStorage` that implements the generated `NativeLocalStorageSpec` interface.

1. Open the CocoPods generated Xcode Workspace:

bash

```
cd ios
open TurboModuleExample.xcworkspace
```

2. Right click on app and select `New Group`, call the new group `NativeLocalStorage`.

3) In the `NativeLocalStorage` group, create `New`→`File from Template`.

4. Use the `Cocoa Touch Class`.

5) Name the Cocoa Touch Class `RCTNativeLocalStorage` with the `Objective-C` language.

6. Rename `RCTNativeLocalStorage.m` → `RCTNativeLocalStorage.mm` making it an Objective-C++ file.

### Implement localStorage with NSUserDefaults

Start by updating `RCTNativeLocalStorage.h`:

NativeLocalStorage/RCTNativeLocalStorage.h

```
//  RCTNativeLocalStorage.h
//  TurboModuleExample

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <NativeLocalStorageSpec/NativeLocalStorageSpec.h>

NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

@interface RCTNativeLocalStorage : NSObject
@interface RCTNativeLocalStorage : NSObject <NativeLocalStorageSpec>

@end
```

Then update our implementation to use `NSUserDefaults` with a custom suite name.

NativeLocalStorage/RCTNativeLocalStorage.mm

```
//  RCTNativeLocalStorage.m
//  TurboModuleExample

#import "RCTNativeLocalStorage.h"

static NSString *const RCTNativeLocalStorageKey = @"local-storage";

@interface RCTNativeLocalStorage()
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSUserDefaults *localStorage;
@end

@implementation RCTNativeLocalStorage

- (id) init {
  if (self = [super init]) {
    _localStorage = [[NSUserDefaults alloc] initWithSuiteName:RCTNativeLocalStorageKey];
  }
  return self;
}

- (std::shared_ptr<facebook::react::TurboModule>)getTurboModule:(const facebook::react::ObjCTurboModule::InitParams &)params {
  return std::make_shared<facebook::react::NativeLocalStorageSpecJSI>(params);
}

- (NSString * _Nullable)getItem:(NSString *)key {
  return [self.localStorage stringForKey:key];
}

- (void)setItem:(NSString *)value
          key:(NSString *)key {
  [self.localStorage setObject:value forKey:key];
}

- (void)removeItem:(NSString *)key {
  [self.localStorage removeObjectForKey:key];
}

- (void)clear {
  NSDictionary *keys = [self.localStorage dictionaryRepresentation];
  for (NSString *key in keys) {
    [self removeItem:key];
  }
}

+ (NSString *)moduleName
{
  return @"NativeLocalStorage";
}

@end
```

Important things to note:

- You can use Xcode to jump to the Codegen `@protocol NativeLocalStorageSpec`. You can also use Xcode to generate stubs for you.

### Register the Native Module in your app

The last step consist in updating the `package.json` to tell React Native about the link between the JS specs of the Native Module and the concrete implementation of those specs in native code.

Modify the `package.json` as it follows:

package.json

```
     "start": "react-native start",
     "test": "jest"
   },
   "codegenConfig": {
     "name": "AppSpecs",
     "type": "modules",
     "jsSrcsDir": "specs",
     "android": {
       "javaPackageName": "com.sampleapp.specs"
     }
     "ios":
        "modulesProvider": {
          "NativeLocalStorage": "RCTNativeLocalStorage"
        }
   },

   "dependencies": {
```

At this point, you need to re-install the pods to make sure that codegen runs again to generate the new files:

bash

```
# from the ios folder
bundle exec pod install
open SampleApp.xcworkspace
```

If you now build your application from Xcode, you should be able to build successfully.

### Build and run your code on a Simulator

- npm
- Yarn

bash

```
npm run ios
```

bash

```
yarn run ios
```

## Cross-Platform Native Modules (C++)

Writing a module in C++ is the best way to share platform-agnostic code between Android and iOS. With pure C++ modules, you can write your logic only once and reuse it right away from all the platforms, without the need of writing platform-specific code.

In this guide, we will go through the creation of a pure C++ Turbo Native Module:

1. Create the JS specs
2. Configure Codegen to generate the scaffolding
3. Implement the Native logic
4. Register the module in the Android and iOS application
5. Test your changes in JS

The rest of this guide assume that you have created your application running the command:

shell

```
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init SampleApp --version 0.76.0
```

### 1. Create the JS specs

Pure C++ Turbo Native Modules are Turbo Native Modules. They need a specification file (also called spec file) so that Codegen can create the scaffolding code for us. The specification file is also what we use to access the Turbo Native Module in JS.

Spec files need to be written in a typed JS dialect. React Native currently supports Flow or TypeScript.

1. Inside the root folder of your app, create a new folder called `specs`.
2. Create a new file called `NativeSampleModule.ts` with the following code:

warning

All Native Turbo Module spec files must have the prefix `Native`, otherwise Codegen will ignore them.

- TypeScript
- Flow

specs/NativeSampleModule.ts

```
// @flow
import type {TurboModule} from 'react-native'
import { TurboModuleRegistry } from "react-native";

export interface Spec extends TurboModule {
  +reverseString: (input: string) => string;
}

export default (TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing<Spec>(
  "NativeSampleModule"
): Spec);
```

specs/NativeSampleModule.ts

```
import {TurboModule, TurboModuleRegistry} from 'react-native';

export interface Spec extends TurboModule {
  readonly reverseString: (input: string) => string;
}

export default TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing<Spec>(
  'NativeSampleModule',
);
```

### 2. Configure Codegen

The next step is to configure Codegen in your `package.json`. Update the file to include:

package.json

```
     "start": "react-native start",
     "test": "jest"
   },
   "codegenConfig": {
     "name": "AppSpecs",
     "type": "modules",
     "jsSrcsDir": "specs",
     "android": {
       "javaPackageName": "com.sampleapp.specs"
     }
   },
   "dependencies": {
```

This configuration tells Codegen to look for spec files in the `specs` folder. It also instructs Codegen to only generate code for `modules` and to namespace the generated code as `AppSpecs`.

### 3. Write the Native Code

Writing a C++ Turbo Native Module allows you to share the code between Android an iOS. Therefore we will be writing the code once, and we will look into what changes we need to apply to the platforms so that the C++ code can be picked up.

1. Create a folder named `shared` at the same level as the `android` and `ios` folders.

2. Inside the `shared` folder, create a new file called `NativeSampleModule.h`.

   shared/NativeSampleModule.h

   ```
   #pragma once

   #include <AppSpecsJSI.h>

   #include <memory>
   #include <string>

   namespace facebook::react {

   class NativeSampleModule : public NativeSampleModuleCxxSpec<NativeSampleModule> {
   public:
     NativeSampleModule(std::shared_ptr<CallInvoker> jsInvoker);

     std::string reverseString(jsi::Runtime& rt, std::string input);
   };

   } // namespace facebook::react
   ```

3. Inside the `shared` folder, create a new file called `NativeSampleModule.cpp`.

   shared/NativeSampleModule.cpp

   ```
   #include "NativeSampleModule.h"

   namespace facebook::react {

   NativeSampleModule::NativeSampleModule(std::shared_ptr<CallInvoker> jsInvoker)
       : NativeSampleModuleCxxSpec(std::move(jsInvoker)) {}

   std::string NativeSampleModule::reverseString(jsi::Runtime& rt, std::string input) {
     return std::string(input.rbegin(), input.rend());
   }

   } // namespace facebook::react
   ```

Let's have a look at the two files we created:

- The `NativeSampleModule.h` file is the header file for a Pure C++ TurboModule. The `include` statements make sure that we include the specs that will be created by Codegen and that contains the interface and the base class we need to implement.
- The module lives in the `facebook::react` namespace to have access to all the types that live in that namespace.
- The class `NativeSampleModule` is the actual Turbo Native Module class and it extends the `NativeSampleModuleCxxSpec` class which contains some glue code and boilerplate code to let this class behave as a Turbo Native Module.
- Finally, we have the constructor, that accepts a pointer to the `CallInvoker`, to communicate with JS if needed and the function's prototype we have to implement.

The `NativeSampleModule.cpp` file is the actual implementation of our Turbo Native Module and implements the constructor and the method that we declared in the specs.

### 4. Register the Module in the platform

The next steps will let us register the module in the platform. This is the step that exposes the native code to JS so that the React Native application can finally call the native methods from the JS layer.

This is the only time when we will have to write some platform-specific code.

#### Android

To make sure that the Android app can effectively build the C++ Turbo Native Module, we need to:

1. Create a `CMakeLists.txt` to access our C++ code.
2. Modify `build.gradle` to point to the newly created `CMakeLists.txt` file.
3. Create an `OnLoad.cpp` file in our Android app to register the new Turbo Native Module.

##### 1. Create the `CMakeLists.txt` file

Android uses CMake to build. CMake needs to access the files we defined in our shared folder to be able to build them.

1. Create a new folder `SampleApp/android/app/src/main/jni`. The `jni` folder is where the C++ side of Android lives.
2. Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file and add this context:

CMakeLists.txt

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)

# Define the library name here.
project(appmodules)

# This file includes all the necessary to let you build your React Native application
include(${REACT_ANDROID_DIR}/cmake-utils/ReactNative-application.cmake)

# Define where the additional source code lives. We need to crawl back the jni, main, src, app, android folders
target_sources(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ../../../../../shared/NativeSampleModule.cpp)

# Define where CMake can find the additional header files. We need to crawl back the jni, main, src, app, android folders
target_include_directories(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ../../../../../shared)
```

The CMake file does the following things:

- Defines the `appmodules` library, where all the app C++ code will be included.
- Loads the base React Native's CMake file.
- Adds the Module C++ source code that we need to build with the `target_sources` directives. By default React Native will already populate the `appmodules` library with default sources, here we include our custom one. You can see that we need to crawl back from the `jni` folder to the `shared` folder where our C++ Turbo Module lives.
- Specifies where CMake can find the module header files. Also in this case we need to crawl back from the `jni` folder.

##### 2. Modify `build.gradle` to include the custom C++ code

Gradle is the tool that orchestrates the Android build. We need to tell it where it can find the `CMake` files to build the Turbo Native Module.

1. Open the `SampleApp/android/app/build.gradle` file.
2. Add the following block into the Gradle file, within the existent `android` block:

android/app/build.gradle

```
    buildTypes {
        debug {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
        }
        release {
            // Caution! In production, you need to generate your own keystore file.
            // see https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android.
            signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
            minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android.txt"), "proguard-rules.pro"
        }
    }

+   externalNativeBuild {
+       cmake {
+           path "src/main/jni/CMakeLists.txt"
+       }
+   }
}
```

This block tells the Gradle file where to look for the CMake file. The path is relative to the folder where the `build.gradle` file lives, so we need to add the path to the `CMakeLists.txt` files in the `jni` folder.

##### 3. Register the new Turbo Native Module

The final step is to register the new C++ Turbo Native Module in the runtime, so that when JS requires the C++ Turbo Native Module, the app knows where to find it and can return it.

1. From the folder `SampleApp/android/app/src/main/jni`, run the following command:

sh

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/react-native/v0.76.0/packages/react-native/ReactAndroid/cmake-utils/default-app-setup/OnLoad.cpp
```

2. Then, modify this file as follows:

android/app/src/main/jni/OnLoad.cpp

```
#include <DefaultComponentsRegistry.h>
#include <DefaultTurboModuleManagerDelegate.h>
#include <autolinking.h>
#include <fbjni/fbjni.h>
#include <react/renderer/componentregistry/ComponentDescriptorProviderRegistry.h>
#include <rncore.h>

+ // Include the NativeSampleModule header
+ #include <NativeSampleModule.h>

//...

std::shared_ptr<TurboModule> cxxModuleProvider(
    const std::string& name,
    const std::shared_ptr<CallInvoker>& jsInvoker) {
  // Here you can provide your CXX Turbo Modules coming from
  // either your application or from external libraries. The approach to follow
  // is similar to the following (for a module called `NativeCxxModuleExample`):
  //
  // if (name == NativeCxxModuleExample::kModuleName) {
  //   return std::make_shared<NativeCxxModuleExample>(jsInvoker);
  // }

+  // This code register the module so that when the JS side asks for it, the app can return it
+  if (name == NativeSampleModule::kModuleName) {
+    return std::make_shared<NativeSampleModule>(jsInvoker);
+  }

  // And we fallback to the CXX module providers autolinked
  return autolinking_cxxModuleProvider(name, jsInvoker);
}

// leave the rest of the file
```

These steps download the original `OnLoad.cpp` file from React Native, so that we can safely override it to load the C++ Turbo Native Module in the app.

Once we downloaded the file, we can modify it by:

- Including the header file that points to our module
- Registering the Turbo Native Module so that when JS requires it, the app can return it.

Now, you can run `yarn android` from the project root to see your app building successfully.

#### iOS

To make sure that the iOS app can effectively build the C++ Turbo Native Module, we need to:

1. Install pods and run Codegen.
2. Add the `shared` folder to our iOS project.
3. Register the C++ Turbo Native Module in the application.

##### 1. Install Pods and Run Codegen.

The first step we need to run is the usual steps we run every time we have to prepare our iOS application. CocoaPods is the tool we use to setup and install React Native dependencies and, as part of the process, it will also run Codegen for us.

bash

```
cd ios
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

##### 2. Add the shared folder to the iOS project

This step adds the `shared` folder to the project to make it visible to Xcode.

1. Open the CocoPods generated Xcode Workspace.

bash

```
cd ios
open SampleApp.xcworkspace
```

2. Click on the `SampleApp` project on the left and select `Add files to "Sample App"...`.

3) Select the `shared` folder and click on `Add`.

If you did everything right, your project on the left should look like this:

##### 3. Registering the Cxx Turbo Native Module in your app

To register a pure Cxx Turbo Native Module in your app, you need to:

1. Create a `ModuleProvider` for the Native Module
2. Configure the `package.json` to associate the JS module name with the ModuleProvider class.

The ModuleProvider is an Objective-C++ that glues together the Pure C++ module with the rest of your iOS App.

###### 3.1 Create the ModuleProvider

1. From Xcode, select the `SampleApp` project and press `⌘` + `N` to create a new file.
2. Select the `Cocoa Touch Class` template
3. Add the name `SampleNativeModuleProvider` (keep the other field as `Subclass of: NSObject` and `Language: Objective-C`)
4. Click Next to generate the files.
5. Rename the `SampleNativeModuleProvider.m` to `SampleNativeModuleProvider.mm`. The `mm` extension denotes an Objective-C++ file.
6. Implement the content of the `SampleNativeModuleProvider.h` with the following:

NativeSampleModuleProvider.h

```

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <ReactCommon/RCTTurboModule.h>

NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

@interface NativeSampleModuleProvider : NSObject <RCTModuleProvider>

@end

NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_END
```

This declares a `NativeSampleModuleProvider` object that conforms to the `RCTModuleProvider` protocol.

7. Implement the content of the `SampleNativeModuleProvider.mm` with the following:

NativeSampleModuleProvider.mm

```

#import "NativeSampleModuleProvider.h"
#import <ReactCommon/CallInvoker.h>
#import <ReactCommon/TurboModule.h>
#import "NativeSampleModule.h"

@implementation NativeSampleModuleProvider

- (std::shared_ptr<facebook::react::TurboModule>)getTurboModule:
    (const facebook::react::ObjCTurboModule::InitParams &)params
{
  return std::make_shared<facebook::react::NativeSampleModule>(params.jsInvoker);
}

@end
```

This code implements the `RCTModuleProvider` protocol by creating the pure C++ `NativeSampleModule` when the `getTurboModule:` method is called.

###### 3.2 Update the package.json

The last step consist in updating the `package.json` to tell React Native about the link between the JS specs of the Native Module and the concrete implementation of those spec in native code.

Modify the `package.json` as it follows:

package.json

```
     "start": "react-native start",
     "test": "jest"
   },
   "codegenConfig": {
     "name": "AppSpecs",
     "type": "modules",
     "jsSrcsDir": "specs",
     "android": {
       "javaPackageName": "com.sampleapp.specs"
     },
     "ios": {
        "modulesProvider": {
          "NativeSampleModule":  "NativeSampleModuleProvider"
        }
     }
   },

   "dependencies": {
```

At this point, you need to re-install the pods to make sure that codegen runs again to generate the new files:

bash

```
# from the ios folder
bundle exec pod install
open SampleApp.xcworkspace
```

If you now build your application from Xcode, you should be able to build successfully.

### 5. Testing your Code

It's now time to access our C++ Turbo Native Module from JS. To do so, we have to modify the `App.tsx` file to import the Turbo Native Module and to call it in our code.

1. Open the `App.tsx` file.
2. Replace the content of the template with the following code:

App.tsx

```
import React from 'react';
import {
  Button,
  SafeAreaView,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  TextInput,
  View,
} from 'react-native';
import SampleTurboModule from './specs/NativeSampleModule';

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');
  const [reversedValue, setReversedValue] = React.useState('');

  const onPress = () => {
    const revString = SampleTurboModule.reverseString(value);
    setReversedValue(revString);
  };

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <View>
        <Text style={styles.title}>
          Welcome to C++ Turbo Native Module Example
        </Text>
        <Text>Write down here he text you want to revert</Text>
        <TextInput
          style={styles.textInput}
          placeholder="Write your text here"
          onChangeText={setValue}
          value={value}
        />
        <Button title="Reverse" onPress={onPress} />
        <Text>Reversed text: {reversedValue}</Text>
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 18,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  textInput: {
    borderColor: 'black',
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderRadius: 5,
    padding: 10,
    marginTop: 10,
  },
});

export default App;
```

The interesting lines in this app are:

- `import SampleTurboModule from './specs/NativeSampleModule';`: this line imports the Turbo Native Module in the app,
- `const revString = SampleTurboModule.reverseString(value);` in the `onPress` callback: this is how you can use the Turbo Native Module in your app.

warning

For the sake of this example and to keep it as short as possible, we directly imported the spec file in our app. The best practice in this case is to create a separate file to wrap the specs and use that file into your application. This allows you to prepare the input for the specs and gives you more control over them in JS.

Congratulations, you wrote your first C++ Turbo Native Module!

## Native Components

If you want to build _new_ React Native Components that wrap around a Host Component like a unique kind of CheckBox on Android, or a UIButton on iOS, you should use a Fabric Native Component.

This guide will show you how to build Fabric Native Components, by implementing a web view component. The steps to doing this are:

1. Define a JavaScript specification using Flow or TypeScript.
2. Configure the dependencies management system to generate code from the provided spec and to be auto-linked.
3. Implement the Native code.
4. Use the Component in an App.

You're going to need a plain template generated application to use the component:

bash

```
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init Demo --install-pods false
```

### Creating a WebView Component

This guide will show you how to create a Web View component. We will be creating the component by using the Android's `WebView` component, and the iOS `WKWebView` component.

Let's start by creating the folders structure to hold our component's code:

bash

```
mkdir -p Demo/{specs,android/app/src/main/java/com/webview}
```

This gives you the following layout where you'll working:

```
Demo
├── android/app/src/main/java/com/webview
└── ios
└── specs
```

- The `android/app/src/main/java/com/webview` folder is the folder that will contain our Android code.
- The `ios` folder is the folder that will contain our iOS code.
- The `specs` folder is the folder that will contain the Codegen's specification file.

### 1. Define Specification for Codegen

Your specification must be defined in either TypeScript or Flow (see Codegen documentation for more details). This is used by Codegen to generate the C++, Objective-C++ and Java to connect your platform code to the JavaScript runtime that React runs in.

The specification file must be named `<MODULE_NAME>NativeComponent.{ts|js}` to work with Codegen. The suffix `NativeComponent` is not only a convention, it is actually used by Codegen to detect a spec file.

Use this specification for our WebView Component:

- TypeScript
- Flow

Demo/specs/WebViewNativeComponent.ts

```
import type {HostComponent, ViewProps} from 'react-native';
import type {BubblingEventHandler} from 'react-native/Libraries/Types/CodegenTypes';
import codegenNativeComponent from 'react-native/Libraries/Utilities/codegenNativeComponent';

type WebViewScriptLoadedEvent = {
  result: 'success' | 'error';
};

export interface NativeProps extends ViewProps {
  sourceURL?: string;
  onScriptLoaded?: BubblingEventHandler<WebViewScriptLoadedEvent> | null;
}

export default codegenNativeComponent<NativeProps>(
  'CustomWebView',
) as HostComponent<NativeProps>;
```

Demo/RCTWebView/js/RCTWebViewNativeComponent.js

```
// @flow strict-local

import type {HostComponent, ViewProps} from 'react-native';
import type {BubblingEventHandler} from 'react-native/Libraries/Types/CodegenTypes';
import codegenNativeComponent from 'react-native/Libraries/Utilities/codegenNativeComponent';

type WebViewScriptLoadedEvent = $ReadOnly<{|
  result: "success" | "error",
|}>;

type NativeProps = $ReadOnly<{|
  ...ViewProps,
  sourceURL?: string;
  onScriptLoaded?: BubblingEventHandler<WebViewScriptLoadedEvent>?;
|}>;

export default (codegenNativeComponent<NativeProps>(
  'CustomWebView',
): HostComponent<NativeProps>);
```

This specification is composed of three main parts, excluding the imports:

- The `WebViewScriptLoadedEvent` is a supporting data type for the data the event needs to pass from native to JavaScript.
- The `NativeProps` is a definition of the props that we can set on the component.
- The `codegenNativeComponent` statement allows us to codegenerate the code for the custom component and that defines a name for the component used to match the native implementations.

As with Native Modules, you can have multiple specification files in the `specs/` directory. For more information about the types you can use, and the platform types these map to, see the appendix.

### 2. Configure Codegen to run

The specification is used by the React Native's Codegen tools to generate platform specific interfaces and boilerplate for us. To do this, Codegen needs to know where to find our specification and what to do with it. Update your `package.json` to include:

json

```
    "start": "react-native start",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "codegenConfig": {
    "name": "AppSpec",
    "type": "components",
    "jsSrcsDir": "specs",
    "android": {
      "javaPackageName": "com.webview"
    },
    "ios": {
      "componentProvider": {
        "CustomWebView": "RCTWebView"
      }
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
```

With everything wired up for Codegen, we need to prepare our native code to hook into our generated code.

Note that for iOS, we are declaratively mapping the name of the JS component that is exported by the spec (`CustomWebView`) with the iOS class that will implement the component natively.

### 2. Building your Native Code

Now it's time to write the native platform code so that when React requires to render a view, the platform can create the right native view and can render it on screen.

You should work through both the Android and iOS platforms.

note

This guide shows you how to create a Native Component that only works with the New Architecture. If you need to support both the New Architecture and the Legacy Architecture, please refer to our backwards compatibility guide.

- Android
- iOS

Now it's time to write some Android platform code to be able to render the web view. The steps you need to follow are:

- Running Codegen
- Write the code for the `ReactWebView`
- Write the code for the `ReactWebViewManager`
- Write the code for the `ReactWebViewPackage`
- Register the `ReactWebViewPackage` in the application

#### 1. Run Codegen through Gradle

Run this once to generate boilerplate that your IDE of choice can use.

Demo/

```
cd android
./gradlew generateCodegenArtifactsFromSchema
```

Codegen will generate the `ViewManager` interface you need to implement and the `ViewManager` delegate for the web view.

#### 2. Write the `ReactWebView`

The `ReactWebView` is the component that wraps the Android native view that React Native will render when using our custom Component.

Create a `ReactWebView.java` or a `ReactWebView.kt` file in the `android/src/main/java/com/webview` folder with this code:

- Java
- Kotlin

Demo/android/src/main/java/com/webview/ReactWebView\.java

```
package com.webview;

import android.content.Context;
import android.util.AttributeSet;
import android.webkit.WebView;
import android.webkit.WebViewClient;

import com.facebook.react.bridge.Arguments;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.WritableMap;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContext;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.UIManagerHelper;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.events.Event;

public class ReactWebView extends WebView {
  public ReactWebView(Context context) {
    super(context);
    configureComponent();
  }

  public ReactWebView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
    super(context, attrs);
    configureComponent();
  }

  public ReactWebView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr) {
    super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr);
    configureComponent();
  }

  private void configureComponent() {
    this.setLayoutParams(new LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
    this.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {
      @Override
      public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) {
        emitOnScriptLoaded(OnScriptLoadedEventResult.success);
      }
    });
  }

  public void emitOnScriptLoaded(OnScriptLoadedEventResult result) {
    ReactContext reactContext = (ReactContext) context;
    int surfaceId = UIManagerHelper.getSurfaceId(reactContext);
    EventDispatcher eventDispatcher = UIManagerHelper.getEventDispatcherForReactTag(reactContext, getId());
    WritableMap payload = Arguments.createMap();
    payload.putString("result", result.name());

    OnScriptLoadedEvent event = new OnScriptLoadedEvent(surfaceId, getId(), payload);
    if (eventDispatcher != null) {
      eventDispatcher.dispatchEvent(event);
    }
  }

  public enum OnScriptLoadedEventResult {
    success,
    error
  }

  private class OnScriptLoadedEvent extends Event<OnScriptLoadedEvent> {
    private final WritableMap payload;

    OnScriptLoadedEvent(int surfaceId, int viewId, WritableMap payload) {
      super(surfaceId, viewId);
      this.payload = payload;
    }

    @Override
    public String getEventName() {
      return "onScriptLoaded";
    }

    @Override
    public WritableMap getEventData() {
      return payload;
    }
  }
}
```

Demo/android/src/main/java/com/webview/ReactWebView\.kt

```
package com.webview

import android.content.Context
import android.util.AttributeSet
import android.webkit.WebView
import android.webkit.WebViewClient
import com.facebook.react.bridge.Arguments
import com.facebook.react.bridge.WritableMap
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContext
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.UIManagerHelper
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.events.Event

class ReactWebView: WebView {
  constructor(context: Context) : super(context) {
    configureComponent()
  }

  constructor(context: Context, attrs: AttributeSet?) : super(context, attrs) {
    configureComponent()
  }

  constructor(context: Context, attrs: AttributeSet?, defStyleAttr: Int) : super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr) {
    configureComponent()
  }

  private fun configureComponent() {
    this.layoutParams = LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT)
    this.webViewClient = object : WebViewClient() {
      override fun onPageFinished(view: WebView, url: String) {
        emitOnScriptLoaded(OnScriptLoadedEventResult.success)
      }
    }
  }

  fun emitOnScriptLoaded(result: OnScriptLoadedEventResult) {
    val reactContext = context as ReactContext
    val surfaceId = UIManagerHelper.getSurfaceId(reactContext)
    val eventDispatcher = UIManagerHelper.getEventDispatcherForReactTag(reactContext, id)
    val payload =
        Arguments.createMap().apply {
          putString("result", result.name)
        }
    val event = OnScriptLoadedEvent(surfaceId, id, payload)

    eventDispatcher?.dispatchEvent(event)
  }

  enum class OnScriptLoadedEventResult {
    success,
    error;
  }

  inner class OnScriptLoadedEvent(
      surfaceId: Int,
      viewId: Int,
      private val payload: WritableMap
  ) : Event<OnScriptLoadedEvent>(surfaceId, viewId) {
    override fun getEventName() = "onScriptLoaded"

    override fun getEventData() = payload
  }
}
```

The `ReactWebView` extends the Android `WebView` so you can reuse all the properties already defined by the platform with ease.

The class defines the three Android constructors but defers their actual implementation to the private `configureComponent` function. This function takes care of initializing all the components specific properties: in this case you are setting the layout of the `WebView` and you are defining the `WebClient` that you use to customize the behavior of the `WebView`. In this code, the `ReactWebView` emits an event when the page finishes loading, by implementing the `WebClient`'s `onPageFinished` method.

The code then defines a helper function to actually emit an event. To emit an event, you have to:

- grab a reference to the `ReactContext`;
- retrieve the `surfaceId` of the view that you are presenting;
- grab a reference to the `eventDispatcher` associated with the view;
- build the payload for the event using a `WritableMap` object;
- create the event object that you need to send to JavaScript;
- call the `eventDispatcher.dispatchEvent` to send the event.

The last part of the file contains the definition of the data types you need to send the event:

- The `OnScriptLoadedEventResult`, with the possible outcomes of the `OnScriptLoaded` event.
- The actual `OnScriptLoadedEvent` that needs to extend the React Native's `Event` class.

#### 3. Write the `WebViewManager`

The `WebViewManager` is the class that connects the React Native runtime with the native view.

When React receives the instruction from the app to render a specific component, React uses the registered view manager to create the view and to pass all the required properties.

This is the code of the `ReactWebViewManager`.

- Java
- Kotlin

Demo/android/src/main/java/com/webview/ReactWebViewManager.java

```
package com.webview;

import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;
import com.facebook.react.module.annotations.ReactModule;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.SimpleViewManager;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ThemedReactContext;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ViewManagerDelegate;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.annotations.ReactProp;
import com.facebook.react.viewmanagers.CustomWebViewManagerInterface;
import com.facebook.react.viewmanagers.CustomWebViewManagerDelegate;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@ReactModule(name = ReactWebViewManager.REACT_CLASS)
class ReactWebViewManager extends SimpleViewManager<ReactWebView> implements CustomWebViewManagerInterface<ReactWebView> {
  private final CustomWebViewManagerDelegate<ReactWebView, ReactWebViewManager> delegate =
          new CustomWebViewManagerDelegate<>(this);

  @Override
  public ViewManagerDelegate<ReactWebView> getDelegate() {
    return delegate;
  }

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return REACT_CLASS;
  }

  @Override
  public ReactWebView createViewInstance(ThemedReactContext context) {
    return new ReactWebView(context);
  }

  @ReactProp(name = "sourceUrl")
  @Override
  public void setSourceURL(ReactWebView view, String sourceURL) {
    if (sourceURL == null) {
      view.emitOnScriptLoaded(ReactWebView.OnScriptLoadedEventResult.error);
      return;
    }
    view.loadUrl(sourceURL, new HashMap<>());
  }

  public static final String REACT_CLASS = "CustomWebView";

  @Override
  public Map<String, Object> getExportedCustomBubblingEventTypeConstants() {
    Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
    Map<String, Object> bubblingMap = new HashMap<>();
    bubblingMap.put("phasedRegistrationNames", new HashMap<String, String>() {{
      put("bubbled", "onScriptLoaded");
      put("captured", "onScriptLoadedCapture");
    }});
    map.put("onScriptLoaded", bubblingMap);
    return map;
  }
}
```

Demo/android/src/main/java/com/webview/ReactWebViewManager.kt

```
package com.webview

import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;
import com.facebook.react.module.annotations.ReactModule;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.SimpleViewManager;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ThemedReactContext;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ViewManagerDelegate;
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.annotations.ReactProp;
import com.facebook.react.viewmanagers.CustomWebViewManagerInterface;
import com.facebook.react.viewmanagers.CustomWebViewManagerDelegate;

@ReactModule(name = ReactWebViewManager.REACT_CLASS)
class ReactWebViewManager(context: ReactApplicationContext) : SimpleViewManager<ReactWebView>(), CustomWebViewManagerInterface<ReactWebView> {
  private val delegate: CustomWebViewManagerDelegate<ReactWebView, ReactWebViewManager> =
    CustomWebViewManagerDelegate(this)

  override fun getDelegate(): ViewManagerDelegate<ReactWebView> = delegate

  override fun getName(): String = REACT_CLASS

  override fun createViewInstance(context: ThemedReactContext): ReactWebView = ReactWebView(context)

  @ReactProp(name = "sourceUrl")
  override fun setSourceURL(view: ReactWebView, sourceURL: String?) {
    if (sourceURL == null) {
      view.emitOnScriptLoaded(ReactWebView.OnScriptLoadedEventResult.error)
      return;
    }
    view.loadUrl(sourceURL, emptyMap())
  }

  companion object {
    const val REACT_CLASS = "CustomWebView"
  }

  override fun getExportedCustomBubblingEventTypeConstants(): Map<String, Any> =
      mapOf(
          "onScriptLoaded" to
              mapOf(
                  "phasedRegistrationNames" to
                      mapOf(
                          "bubbled" to "onScriptLoaded",
                          "captured" to "onScriptLoadedCapture"
                      )))
}
```

The `ReactWebViewManager` extends the `SimpleViewManager` class from React and implements the `CustomWebViewManagerInterface`, generated by Codegen.

It holds a reference of the `CustomWebViewManagerDelegate`, another element generated by Codegen.

It then overrides the `getName` function, which must return the same name used in the spec's `codegenNativeComponent` function call.

The `createViewInstance` function is responsible to instantiate a new `ReactWebView`.

Then, the ViewManager needs to define how all the React's components props will update the native view. In the example, you need to decide how to handle the `sourceURL` property that React will set on the `WebView`.

Finally, if the component can emit an event, you need to map the event name by overriding the `getExportedCustomBubblingEventTypeConstants` for bubbling events, or the `getExportedCustomDirectEventTypeConstants` for direct events.

#### 4. Write the `ReactWebViewPackage`

As you do with Native Modules, Native Components also need to implement the `ReactPackage` class. This is an object that you can use to register the component in the React Native runtime.

This is the code for the `ReactWebViewPackage`:

- Java
- Kotlin

Demo/android/src/main/java/com/webview/ReactWebViewPackage.java

```
package com.webview;

import com.facebook.react.BaseReactPackage;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule;

import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext
import com.facebook.react.module.model.ReactModuleInfo
import com.facebook.react.module.model.ReactModuleInfoProvider
import com.facebook.react.uimanager.ViewManager

class ReactWebViewPackage : BaseReactPackage() {
  override fun createViewManagers(reactContext: ReactApplicationContext): List<ViewManager<*, *>> {
    return listOf(ReactWebViewManager(reactContext))
  }

  override fun getModule(s: String, reactApplicationContext: ReactApplicationContext): NativeModule? {
    when (s) {
      ReactWebViewManager.REACT_CLASS -> ReactWebViewManager(reactApplicationContext)
    }
    return null
  }

  override fun getReactModuleInfoProvider(): ReactModuleInfoProvider = ReactModuleInfoProvider {
    mapOf(ReactWebViewManager.REACT_CLASS to ReactModuleInfo(

      isCxxModule = false,
      isTurboModule = true,
    )
    )
  }
}
```

The `ReactWebViewPackage` extends the `BaseReactPackage` and implements all the methods required to properly register our component.

- the `createViewManagers` method is the factory method that creates the `ViewManager` that manage the custom views.
- the `getModule` method returns the proper ViewManager depending on the View that React Native needs to render.
- the `getReactModuleInfoProvider` provides all the information required when registering the module in the runtime,

#### 5. Register the `ReactWebViewPackage` in the application

Finally, you need to register the `ReactWebViewPackage` in the application. We do that by modifying the `MainApplication` file by adding the `ReactWebViewPackage` to the list of packages returned by the `getPackages` function.

Demo/app/src/main/java/com/demo/MainApplication.kt

```
package com.demo

import android.app.Application
import com.facebook.react.PackageList
import com.facebook.react.ReactApplication
import com.facebook.react.ReactHost
import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost
import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.load
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactHost.getDefaultReactHost
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactNativeHost
import com.facebook.react.soloader.OpenSourceMergedSoMapping
import com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader
import com.webview.ReactWebViewPackage

class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {

  override val reactNativeHost: ReactNativeHost =
      object : DefaultReactNativeHost(this) {
        override fun getPackages(): List<ReactPackage> =
            PackageList(this).packages.apply {
              add(ReactWebViewPackage())
            }

        override fun getJSMainModuleName(): String = "index"

        override fun getUseDeveloperSupport(): Boolean = BuildConfig.DEBUG

        override val isNewArchEnabled: Boolean = BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED
        override val isHermesEnabled: Boolean = BuildConfig.IS_HERMES_ENABLED
      }

  override val reactHost: ReactHost
    get() = getDefaultReactHost(applicationContext, reactNativeHost)

  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    SoLoader.init(this, OpenSourceMergedSoMapping)
    if (BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED) {
      load()
    }
  }
}
```

Now it's time to write some iOS platform code to be able to render the web view. The steps you need to follow are:

- Run Codegen.
- Write the code for the `RCTWebView`
- Register the `RCTWebView` in the application

#### 1. Run Codegen

You can manually run the Codegen, however it's simpler to use the application you're going to demo the component in to do this for you.

bash

```
cd ios
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

Importantly you will see logging output from Codegen, which we're going to use in Xcode to build our WebView native component.

warning

You should be careful about committing generated code to your repository. Generated code is specific to each version of React Native. Use npm peerDependencies to restrict compatibility with version of React Native.

#### 3. Write the `RCTWebView`

We need to prepare your iOS project using Xcode by completing these **5 steps**:

1. Open the CocoPods generated Xcode Workspace:

bash

```
cd ios
open Demo.xcworkspace
```

2. Right click on app and select `New Group`, call the new group `WebView`.

3) In the `WebView` group, create `New`→`File from Template`.

4. Use the `Objective-C File` template, and name it `RCTWebView`.

5) Repeat step 4 and create a header file named `RCTWebView.h`.

6) Rename `RCTWebView.m` → `RCTWebView.mm` making it an Objective-C++ file.

Demo/ios

```
Podfile
...
Demo
├── AppDelegate.swift
...
├── RCTWebView.h
└── RCTWebView.mm
```

After creating the header file and the implementation file, you can start implementing them.

This is the code for the `RCTWebView.h` file, which declares the component interface.

Demo/RCTWebView/RCTWebView\.h

```
#import <React/RCTViewComponentView.h>
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

@interface RCTWebView : RCTViewComponentView

// You would declare native methods you'd want to access from the view here

@end

NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_END
```

This class defines an `RCTWebView` which extends the `RCTViewComponentView` class. This is the base class for all the native components and it is provided by React Native.

The code for the implementation file (`RCTWebView.mm`) is the following:

Demo/RCTWebView/RCTWebView\.mm

```
#import "RCTWebView.h"

#import <react/renderer/components/AppSpec/ComponentDescriptors.h>
#import <react/renderer/components/AppSpec/EventEmitters.h>
#import <react/renderer/components/AppSpec/Props.h>
#import <react/renderer/components/AppSpec/RCTComponentViewHelpers.h>
#import <WebKit/WebKit.h>

using namespace facebook::react;

@interface RCTWebView () <RCTCustomWebViewViewProtocol, WKNavigationDelegate>
@end

@implementation RCTWebView {
  NSURL * _sourceURL;
  WKWebView * _webView;
}

-(instancetype)init
{
  if(self = [super init]) {
    _webView = [WKWebView new];
    _webView.navigationDelegate = self;
    [self addSubview:_webView];
  }
  return self;
}

- (void)updateProps:(Props::Shared const &)props oldProps:(Props::Shared const &)oldProps
{
  const auto &oldViewProps = *std::static_pointer_cast<CustomWebViewProps const>(_props);
  const auto &newViewProps = *std::static_pointer_cast<CustomWebViewProps const>(props);

  // Handle your props here
  if (oldViewProps.sourceURL != newViewProps.sourceURL) {
    NSString *urlString = [NSString stringWithCString:newViewProps.sourceURL.c_str() encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    _sourceURL = [NSURL URLWithString:urlString];
    if ([self urlIsValid:newViewProps.sourceURL]) {
      [_webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:_sourceURL]];
    }
  }

  [super updateProps:props oldProps:oldProps];
}

-(void)layoutSubviews
{
  [super layoutSubviews];
  _webView.frame = self.bounds;

}

#pragma mark - WKNavigationDelegate

-(void)webView:(WKWebView *)webView didFinishNavigation:(WKNavigation *)navigation
{
  CustomWebViewEventEmitter::OnScriptLoaded result = CustomWebViewEventEmitter::OnScriptLoaded{CustomWebViewEventEmitter::OnScriptLoadedResult::Success};
  self.eventEmitter.onScriptLoaded(result);
}

- (BOOL)urlIsValid:(std::string)propString
{
  if (propString.length() > 0 && !_sourceURL) {
    CustomWebViewEventEmitter::OnScriptLoaded result = CustomWebViewEventEmitter::OnScriptLoaded{CustomWebViewEventEmitter::OnScriptLoadedResult::Error};

    self.eventEmitter.onScriptLoaded(result);
    return NO;
  }
  return YES;
}

// Event emitter convenience method
- (const CustomWebViewEventEmitter &)eventEmitter
{
  return static_cast<const CustomWebViewEventEmitter &>(*_eventEmitter);
}

+ (ComponentDescriptorProvider)componentDescriptorProvider
{
  return concreteComponentDescriptorProvider<CustomWebViewComponentDescriptor>();
}

@end
```

This code is written in Objective-C++ and contains various details:

- the `@interface` implements two protocols:

  - `RCTCustomWebViewViewProtocol`, generated by Codegen;
  - `WKNavigationDelegate`, provided by the WebKit framework to handle the web view navigation events;

- the `init` method that instantiates the `WKWebView`, adds it to the subviews and that sets the `navigationDelegate`;

- the `updateProps` method that is called by React Native when the component's props change;

- the `layoutSubviews` method that describes how the custom view needs to be laid out;

- the `webView:didFinishNavigation:` method that lets you handle what to do when the `WKWebView` finishes loading the page;

- the `urlIsValid:(std::string)propString` method that checks whether the URL received as prop is valid;

- the `eventEmitter` method which is a utility to retrieve a strongly typed `eventEmitter` instance

- the `componentDescriptorProvider` which returns the `ComponentDescriptor` generated by Codegen;

##### Add WebKit framework

note

This step is only required because we are creating a Web view. Web components on iOS needs to be linked against the WebKit framework provided by Apple. If your component doesn't need to access web-specific features, you can skip this step.

A web view requires access to some features that Apple provides through one of the frameworks shipped with Xcode and the devices: WebKit. You can see it in the native code by the `#import <WebKit/WebKit.h>` line added in the `RCTWebView.mm`.

To link the WebKit framework in your app, follow these steps:

1. In Xcode, Click on your project
2. Select the app target
3. Select the General tab
4. Scroll down until you find the _"Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Contents"_ section, and press the `+` button

5) In the search bar, filter for WebKit
6) Select the WebKit framework
7) Click on Add.

### 3. Use your Native Component

Finally, you can use the new component in your app. Update your generated `App.tsx` to:

Demo/App.tsx

```
import React from 'react';
import {Alert, StyleSheet, View} from 'react-native';
import WebView from './specs/WebViewNativeComponent';

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <WebView
        sourceURL="https://react.dev/"
        style={styles.webview}
        onScriptLoaded={() => {
          Alert.alert('Page Loaded');
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    alignContent: 'center',
  },
  webview: {
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
  },
});

export default App;
```

This code creates an app that uses the new `WebView` component we created to load the `react.dev` website.

The app also shows an alert when the web page is loaded.

### 4. Run your App using the WebView Component

- Android
- iOS

bash

```
yarn run android
```

bash

```
yarn run ios
```

## LayoutAnimation

Automatically animates views to their new positions when the next layout happens.

A common way to use this API is to call it before updating the state hook in functional components and calling `setState` in class components.

Note that in order to get this to work on **Android** you need to set the following flags via `UIManager`:

js

```
if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
  if (UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental) {
    UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true);
  }
}
```

### Example

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `configureNext()`

```
static configureNext(
  config: LayoutAnimationConfig,
  onAnimationDidEnd?: () => void,
  onAnimationDidFail?: () => void,
);
```

Schedules an animation to happen on the next layout.

##### Parameters:

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| config | object | Yes | See config description below. |
| onAnimationDidEnd | function | No | Called when the animation finished. |
| onAnimationDidFail | function | No | Called when the animation failed. |

The `config` parameter is an object with the keys below. `create` returns a valid object for `config`, and the `Presets` objects can also all be passed as the `config`.

- `duration` in milliseconds
- `create`, optional config for animating in new views
- `update`, optional config for animating views that have been updated
- `delete`, optional config for animating views as they are removed

The config that's passed to `create`, `update`, or `delete` has the following keys:

- `type`, the animation type to use
- `property`, the layout property to animate (optional, but recommended for `create` and `delete`)
- `springDamping` (number, optional and only for use with `type: Type.spring`)
- `initialVelocity` (number, optional)
- `delay` (number, optional)
- `duration` (number, optional)

---

#### `create()`

```
static create(duration, type, creationProp)
```

Helper that creates an object (with `create`, `update`, and `delete` fields) to pass into `configureNext`. The `type` parameter is an animation type, and the `creationProp` parameter is a layout property.

**Example:**

### Properties

#### Types

An enumeration of animation types to be used in the `create` method, or in the `create`/`update`/`delete` configs for `configureNext`. (example usage: `LayoutAnimation.Types.easeIn`)

| Types         |
| ------------- |
| spring        |
| linear        |
| easeInEaseOut |
| easeIn        |
| easeOut       |
| keyboard      |

---

#### Properties

An enumeration of layout properties to be animated to be used in the `create` method, or in the `create`/`update`/`delete` configs for `configureNext`. (example usage: `LayoutAnimation.Properties.opacity`)

| Properties |
| ---------- |
| opacity    |
| scaleX     |
| scaleY     |
| scaleXY    |

---

#### Presets

A set of predefined animation configs to pass into `configureNext`.

| Presets | Value |
| --- | --- |
| easeInEaseOut | `create(300, 'easeInEaseOut', 'opacity')` |
| linear | `create(500, 'linear', 'opacity')` |
| spring | `{duration: 700, create: {type: 'linear', property: 'opacity'}, update: {type: 'spring', springDamping: 0.4}, delete: {type: 'linear', property: 'opacity'} }` |

---

#### `easeInEaseOut`

Calls `configureNext()` with `Presets.easeInEaseOut`.

---

#### `linear`

Calls `configureNext()` with `Presets.linear`.

---

#### `spring`

Calls `configureNext()` with `Presets.spring`.

**Example:**

## PermissionsAndroid

#### Project with Native Code Required

The following section only applies to projects with native code exposed. If you are using the managed Expo workflow, see the guide on Permissions in the Expo documentation for the appropriate alternative.

`PermissionsAndroid` provides access to Android M's new permissions model. The so-called "normal" permissions are granted by default when the application is installed as long as they appear in `AndroidManifest.xml`. However, "dangerous" permissions require a dialog prompt. You should use this module for those permissions.

On devices before SDK version 23, the permissions are automatically granted if they appear in the manifest, so `check` should always result to `true` and `request` should always resolve to `PermissionsAndroid.RESULTS.GRANTED`.

If a user has previously turned off a permission that you prompt for, the OS will advise your app to show a rationale for needing the permission. The optional `rationale` argument will show a dialog prompt only if necessary - otherwise the normal permission prompt will appear.

#### Example

## ToastAndroid

React Native's ToastAndroid API exposes the Android platform's ToastAndroid module as a JS module. It provides the method `show(message, duration)` which takes the following parameters:

- _message_ A string with the text to toast
- _duration_ The duration of the toast—either `ToastAndroid.SHORT` or `ToastAndroid.LONG`

You can alternatively use `showWithGravity(message, duration, gravity)` to specify where the toast appears in the screen's layout. May be `ToastAndroid.TOP`, `ToastAndroid.BOTTOM` or `ToastAndroid.CENTER`.

The `showWithGravityAndOffset(message, duration, gravity, xOffset, yOffset)` method adds the ability to specify an offset with in pixels.

> Starting with Android 11 (API level 30), setting the gravity has no effect on text toasts. Read about the changes here.

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `show()`

```
static show(message: string, duration: number);
```

---

#### `showWithGravity()`

This property will only work on Android API 29 and below. For similar functionality on higher Android APIs, consider using snackbar or notification.

```
static showWithGravity(message: string, duration: number, gravity: number);
```

---

#### `showWithGravityAndOffset()`

This property will only work on Android API 29 and below. For similar functionality on higher Android APIs, consider using snackbar or notification.

```
static showWithGravityAndOffset(
  message: string,
  duration: number,
  gravity: number,
  xOffset: number,
  yOffset: number,
);
```

### Properties

#### `SHORT`

Indicates the duration on the screen.

```
static SHORT: number;
```

---

#### `LONG`

Indicates the duration on the screen.

```
static LONG: number;
```

---

#### `TOP`

Indicates the position on the screen.

```
static TOP: number;
```

---

#### `BOTTOM`

Indicates the position on the screen.

```
static BOTTOM: number;
```

---

#### `CENTER`

Indicates the position on the screen.

```
static CENTER: number;
```

## Appearance

```
import {Appearance} from 'react-native';
```

The `Appearance` module exposes information about the user's appearance preferences, such as their preferred color scheme (light or dark).

##### Developer notes

- Android
- iOS
- Web

> The color scheme preference will map to the user's Light or Dark theme preference on Android 10 (API level 29) devices and higher.

> The color scheme preference will map to the user's Light or Dark Mode preference on iOS 13 devices and higher.

> Note: When taking a screenshot, by default, the color scheme may flicker between light and dark mode. It happens because the iOS takes snapshots on both color schemes and updating the user interface with color scheme is asynchronous.

### Example

You can use the `Appearance` module to determine if the user prefers a dark color scheme:

```
const colorScheme = Appearance.getColorScheme();
if (colorScheme === 'dark') {
  // Use dark color scheme
}
```

Although the color scheme is available immediately, this may change (e.g. scheduled color scheme change at sunrise or sunset). Any rendering logic or styles that depend on the user preferred color scheme should try to call this function on every render, rather than caching the value. For example, you may use the `useColorScheme` React hook as it provides and subscribes to color scheme updates, or you may use inline styles rather than setting a value in a `StyleSheet`.

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `getColorScheme()`

```
static getColorScheme(): 'light' | 'dark' | null;
```

Indicates the current user preferred color scheme. The value may be updated later, either through direct user action (e.g. theme selection in device settings or application-level selected user interface style via `setColorScheme`) or on a schedule (e.g. light and dark themes that follow the day/night cycle).

Supported color schemes:

- `light`: The user prefers a light color theme.
- `dark`: The user prefers a dark color theme.
- null: The user has not indicated a preferred color theme.

See also: `useColorScheme` hook.

> Note: `getColorScheme()` will always return `light` when debugging with Chrome.

---

#### `setColorScheme()`

```
static setColorScheme('light' | 'dark' | null): void;
```

Force the application to always adopt a light or dark interface style. The default value is `null` which causes the application to inherit the system's interface style. If you assign a different value, the new style applies to the application and all native elements within the application (Alerts, Pickers etc).

Supported color schemes:

- `light`: Apply light user interface style.
- `dark`: Apply dark user interface style.
- null: Follow the system's interface style.

> Note: The change will not affect the system's selected interface style or any style set in other applications.

---

#### `addChangeListener()`

```
static addChangeListener(
  listener: (preferences: {colorScheme: 'light' | 'dark' | null}) => void,
): NativeEventSubscription;
```

Add an event handler that is fired when appearance preferences change.

**React Native allows developers who know React to create native apps.** At the same time, native developers can use React Native to gain parity between native platforms by writing common features once.

We believe that the best way to experience React Native is through a **Framework**, a toolbox with all the necessary APIs to let you build production ready apps.

You can also use React Native without a Framework, however we’ve found that most developers benefit from using a React Native Framework like Expo. Expo provides features like file-based routing, high-quality universal libraries, and the ability to write plugins that modify native code without having to manage native files.

Can I use React Native without a Framework?

Yes. You can use React Native without a Framework. **However, if you’re building a new app with React Native, we recommend using a Framework.**

In short, you’ll be able to spend time writing your app instead of writing an entire Framework yourself in addition to your app.

The React Native community has spent years refining approaches to navigation, accessing native APIs, dealing with native dependencies, and more. Most apps need these core features. A React Native Framework provides them from the start of your app.

Without a Framework, you’ll either have to write your own solutions to implement core features, or you’ll have to piece together a collection of pre-existing libraries to create a skeleton of a Framework. This takes real work, both when starting your app, then later when maintaining it.

If your app has unusual constraints that are not served well by a Framework, or you prefer to solve these problems yourself, you can make a React Native app without a Framework using Android Studio, Xcode. If you’re interested in this path, learn how to set up your environment and how to get started without a framework.

## Start a new React Native project with Expo

**Platform support**

Android

iOS

TV

Web

Expo is a production-grade React Native Framework. Expo provides developer tooling that makes developing apps easier, such as file-based routing, a standard library of native modules, and much more.

Expo's Framework is free and open source, with an active community on GitHub and Discord. The Expo team works in close collaboration with the React Native team at Meta to bring the latest React Native features to the Expo SDK.

The team at Expo also provides Expo Application Services (EAS), an optional set of services that complements Expo, the Framework, in each step of the development process.

To create a new Expo project, run the following in your terminal:

shell

```
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

Once you’ve created your app, check out the rest of Expo’s getting started guide to start developing your app.

## AppRegistry

#### Project with Native Code Required

If you are using the managed Expo workflow there is only ever one entry component registered with `AppRegistry` and it is handled automatically (or through registerRootComponent). You do not need to use this API.

`AppRegistry` is the JS entry point to running all React Native apps. App root components should register themselves with `AppRegistry.registerComponent`, then the native system can load the bundle for the app and then actually run the app when it's ready by invoking `AppRegistry.runApplication`.

```
import {Text, AppRegistry} from 'react-native';

const App = () => (
  <View>
    <Text>App1</Text>
  </View>
);

AppRegistry.registerComponent('Appname', () => App);
```

To "stop" an application when a view should be destroyed, call `AppRegistry.unmountApplicationComponentAtRootTag` with the tag that was passed into `runApplication`. These should always be used as a pair.

`AppRegistry` should be required early in the `require` sequence to make sure the JS execution environment is setup before other modules are required.

## PixelRatio

`PixelRatio` gives you access to the device's pixel density and font scale.

### Fetching a correctly sized image

You should get a higher resolution image if you are on a high pixel density device. A good rule of thumb is to multiply the size of the image you display by the pixel ratio.

```
const image = getImage({
  width: PixelRatio.getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(200),
  height: PixelRatio.getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(100),
});
<Image source={image} style={{width: 200, height: 100}} />;
```

### Pixel grid snapping

In iOS, you can specify positions and dimensions for elements with arbitrary precision, for example 29.674825. But, ultimately the physical display only have a fixed number of pixels, for example 640×1136 for iPhone SE (1st generation) or 828×1792 for iPhone 11. iOS tries to be as faithful as possible to the user value by spreading one original pixel into multiple ones to trick the eye. The downside of this technique is that it makes the resulting element look blurry.

In practice, we found out that developers do not want this feature and they have to work around it by doing manual rounding in order to avoid having blurry elements. In React Native, we are rounding all the pixels automatically.

We have to be careful when to do this rounding. You never want to work with rounded and unrounded values at the same time as you're going to accumulate rounding errors. Having even one rounding error is deadly because a one pixel border may vanish or be twice as big.

In React Native, everything in JavaScript and within the layout engine works with arbitrary precision numbers. It's only when we set the position and dimensions of the native element on the main thread that we round. Also, rounding is done relative to the root rather than the parent, again to avoid accumulating rounding errors.

### Example

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `get()`

```
static get(): number;
```

Returns the device pixel density. Some examples:

- `PixelRatio.get() === 1` \*

- `PixelRatio.get() === 1.5` \*

- `PixelRatio.get() === 2`

  - iPhone SE, 6S, 7, 8
  - iPhone XR
  - iPhone 11
  -

- `PixelRatio.get() === 3`

  - iPhone 6S Plus, 7 Plus, 8 Plus
  - iPhone X, XS, XS Max
  - iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max
  - Pixel, Pixel 2
  -

- `PixelRatio.get() === 3.5`

  - Nexus 6
  - Pixel XL, Pixel 2 XL
  -

---

#### `getFontScale()`

```
static getFontScale(): number;
```

Returns the scaling factor for font sizes. This is the ratio that is used to calculate the absolute font size, so any elements that heavily depend on that should use this to do calculations.

- on Android value reflects the user preference set in **Settings > Display > Font size**
- on iOS value reflects the user preference set in **Settings > Display & Brightness > Text Size**, value can also be updated in **Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Larger Text**

If a font scale is not set, this returns the device pixel ratio.

---

#### `getPixelSizeForLayoutSize()`

```
static getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(layoutSize: number): number;
```

Converts a layout size (dp) to pixel size (px).

Guaranteed to return an integer number.

---

#### `roundToNearestPixel()`

```
static roundToNearestPixel(layoutSize: number): number;
```

Rounds a layout size (dp) to the nearest layout size that corresponds to an integer number of pixels. For example, on a device with a PixelRatio of 3, `PixelRatio.roundToNearestPixel(8.4) = 8.33`, which corresponds to exactly (8.33 \* 3) = 25 pixels.

## FlatList

A performant interface for rendering basic, flat lists, supporting the most handy features:

- Fully cross-platform.
- Optional horizontal mode.
- Configurable viewability callbacks.
- Header support.
- Footer support.
- Separator support.
- Pull to Refresh.
- Scroll loading.
- ScrollToIndex support.
- Multiple column support.

If you need section support, use `<SectionList>`.

### Example

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

To render multiple columns, use the `numColumns` prop. Using this approach instead of a `flexWrap` layout can prevent conflicts with the item height logic.

More complex, selectable example below.

- By passing `extraData={selectedId}` to `FlatList` we make sure `FlatList` itself will re-render when the state changes. Without setting this prop, `FlatList` would not know it needs to re-render any items because it is a `PureComponent` and the prop comparison will not show any changes.
- `keyExtractor` tells the list to use the `id`s for the react keys instead of the default `key` property.

* TypeScript
* JavaScript

This is a convenience wrapper around `<VirtualizedList>`, and thus inherits its props (as well as those of `<ScrollView>`) that aren't explicitly listed here, along with the following caveats:

- Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.
- This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.
- In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application, and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.
- By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key. Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.

---

### Reference

### Props

#### VirtualizedList Props

Inherits VirtualizedList Props.

---

#### Require&#x64;**`renderItem`**&#x200B;

```
renderItem({
  item: ItemT,
  index: number,
  separators: {
    highlight: () => void;
    unhighlight: () => void;
    updateProps: (select: 'leading' | 'trailing', newProps: any) => void;
  }
}): JSX.Element;
```

Takes an item from `data` and renders it into the list.

Provides additional metadata like `index` if you need it, as well as a more generic `separators.updateProps` function which let you set whatever props you want to change the rendering of either the leading separator or trailing separator in case the more common `highlight` and `unhighlight` (which set the `highlighted: boolean` prop) are insufficient for your use case.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

- `item` (Object): The item from `data` being rendered.

- `index` (number): The index corresponding to this item in the `data` array.

- `separators` (Object)

  - `highlight` (Function)

  - `unhighlight` (Function)

  - `updateProps` (Function)

    - `select` (enum('leading', 'trailing'))
    - `newProps` (Object)

Example usage:

```
<FlatList
  ItemSeparatorComponent={
    Platform.OS !== 'android' &&
    (({highlighted}) => (
      <View
        style={[style.separator, highlighted && {marginLeft: 0}]}
      />
    ))
  }
  data={[{title: 'Title Text', key: 'item1'}]}
  renderItem={({item, index, separators}) => (
    <TouchableHighlight
      key={item.key}
      onPress={() => this._onPress(item)}
      onShowUnderlay={separators.highlight}
      onHideUnderlay={separators.unhighlight}>
      <View style={{backgroundColor: 'white'}}>
        <Text>{item.title}</Text>
      </View>
    </TouchableHighlight>
  )}
/>
```

---

#### Require&#x64;**`data`**&#x200B;

An array (or array-like list) of items to render. Other data types can be used by targeting `VirtualizedList` directly.

| Type      |
| --------- |
| ArrayLike |

---

#### `ItemSeparatorComponent`

Rendered in between each item, but not at the top or bottom. By default, `highlighted` and `leadingItem` props are provided. `renderItem` provides `separators.highlight`/`unhighlight` which will update the `highlighted` prop, but you can also add custom props with `separators.updateProps`. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type                         |
| ---------------------------- |
| component, function, element |

---

#### `ListEmptyComponent`

Rendered when the list is empty. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `ListFooterComponent`

Rendered at the bottom of all the items. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `ListFooterComponentStyle`

Styling for internal View for `ListFooterComponent`.

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `ListHeaderComponent`

Rendered at the top of all the items. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `ListHeaderComponentStyle`

Styling for internal View for `ListHeaderComponent`.

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `columnWrapperStyle`

Optional custom style for multi-item rows generated when `numColumns > 1`.

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `extraData`

A marker property for telling the list to re-render (since it implements `PureComponent`). If any of your `renderItem`, Header, Footer, etc. functions depend on anything outside of the `data` prop, stick it here and treat it immutably.

| Type |
| ---- |
| any  |

---

#### `getItemLayout`

```
(data, index) => {length: number, offset: number, index: number}
```

`getItemLayout` is an optional optimization that allows skipping the measurement of dynamic content if you know the size (height or width) of items ahead of time. `getItemLayout` is efficient if you have fixed size items, for example:

```
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => (
    {length: ITEM_HEIGHT, offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index, index}
  )}
```

Adding `getItemLayout` can be a great performance boost for lists of several hundred items. Remember to include separator length (height or width) in your offset calculation if you specify `ItemSeparatorComponent`.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `horizontal`

If `true`, renders items next to each other horizontally instead of stacked vertically.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `initialNumToRender`

How many items to render in the initial batch. This should be enough to fill the screen but not much more. Note these items will never be unmounted as part of the windowed rendering in order to improve perceived performance of scroll-to-top actions.

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| number | `10`    |

---

#### `initialScrollIndex`

Instead of starting at the top with the first item, start at `initialScrollIndex`. This disables the "scroll to top" optimization that keeps the first `initialNumToRender` items always rendered and immediately renders the items starting at this initial index. Requires `getItemLayout` to be implemented.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `inverted`

Reverses the direction of scroll. Uses scale transforms of `-1`.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `keyExtractor`

```
(item: ItemT, index: number) => string;
```

Used to extract a unique key for a given item at the specified index. Key is used for caching and as the react key to track item re-ordering. The default extractor checks `item.key`, then `item.id`, and then falls back to using the index, like React does.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `numColumns`

Multiple columns can only be rendered with `horizontal={false}` and will zig-zag like a `flexWrap` layout. Items should all be the same height - masonry layouts are not supported.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `onRefresh`

```
() => void;
```

If provided, a standard RefreshControl will be added for "Pull to Refresh" functionality. Make sure to also set the `refreshing` prop correctly.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `onViewableItemsChanged`

Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the `viewabilityConfig` prop.

| Type                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `(callback: {changed: ViewToken[], viewableItems: ViewToken[]} => void;` |

---

#### `progressViewOffset`

Set this when offset is needed for the loading indicator to show correctly.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `refreshing`

Set this true while waiting for new data from a refresh.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `removeClippedSubviews`

This may improve scroll performance for large lists. On Android the default value is `true`.

> Note: May have bugs (missing content) in some circumstances - use at your own risk.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `viewabilityConfig`

See `ViewabilityHelper.js` for flow type and further documentation.

| Type              |
| ----------------- |
| ViewabilityConfig |

`viewabilityConfig` takes a type `ViewabilityConfig` an object with following properties

| Property                         | Type    |
| -------------------------------- | ------- |
| minimumViewTime                  | number  |
| viewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold | number  |
| itemVisiblePercentThreshold      | number  |
| waitForInteraction               | boolean |

At least one of the `viewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold` or `itemVisiblePercentThreshold` is required. This needs to be done in the `constructor` to avoid following error (ref):

```
  Error: Changing viewabilityConfig on the fly is not supported
```

```
constructor (props) {
  super(props)

  this.viewabilityConfig = {
      waitForInteraction: true,
      viewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold: 95
  }
}
```

```
<FlatList
    viewabilityConfig={this.viewabilityConfig}
  ...
```

##### minimumViewTime

Minimum amount of time (in milliseconds) that an item must be physically viewable before the viewability callback will be fired. A high number means that scrolling through content without stopping will not mark the content as viewable.

##### viewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold

Percent of viewport that must be covered for a partially occluded item to count as "viewable", 0-100. Fully visible items are always considered viewable. A value of 0 means that a single pixel in the viewport makes the item viewable, and a value of 100 means that an item must be either entirely visible or cover the entire viewport to count as viewable.

##### itemVisiblePercentThreshold

Similar to `viewAreaCoveragePercentThreshold`, but considers the percent of the item that is visible, rather than the fraction of the viewable area it covers.

##### waitForInteraction

Nothing is considered viewable until the user scrolls or `recordInteraction` is called after render.

---

#### `viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs`

List of `ViewabilityConfig`/`onViewableItemsChanged` pairs. A specific `onViewableItemsChanged` will be called when its corresponding `ViewabilityConfig`'s conditions are met. See `ViewabilityHelper.js` for flow type and further documentation.

| Type                                   |
| -------------------------------------- |
| array of ViewabilityConfigCallbackPair |

## AccessibilityInfo

Sometimes it's useful to know whether or not the device has a screen reader that is currently active. The `AccessibilityInfo` API is designed for this purpose. You can use it to query the current state of the screen reader as well as to register to be notified when the state of the screen reader changes.

### Example

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `addEventListener()`

```
static addEventListener(
  eventName: AccessibilityChangeEventName | AccessibilityAnnouncementEventName,
  handler: (
    event: AccessibilityChangeEvent | AccessibilityAnnouncementFinishedEvent,
  ) => void,
): EmitterSubscription;
```

Add an event handler. Supported events:

| Event name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `accessibilityServiceChanged`Android | Fires when some services such as TalkBack, other Android assistive technologies, and third-party accessibility services are enabled. The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when a some accessibility services is enabled and `false` otherwise. |
| `announcementFinished`iOS | Fires when the screen reader has finished making an announcement. The argument to the event handler is a dictionary with these keys:- `announcement`: The string announced by the screen reader. |

- `success`: A boolean indicating whether the announcement was successfully made. | \| `boldTextChanged`iOS | Fires when the state of the bold text toggle changes. The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when bold text is enabled and `false` otherwise. | \| `grayscaleChanged`iOS | Fires when the state of the gray scale toggle changes. The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when a gray scale is enabled and `false` otherwise. | \| `invertColorsChanged`iOS | Fires when the state of the invert colors toggle changes. The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when invert colors is enabled and `false` otherwise. | \| `reduceMotionChanged` | Fires when the state of the reduce motion toggle changes. The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when a reduce motion is enabled (or when "Transition Animation Scale" in "Developer options" is "Animation off") and `false` otherwise. | \| `reduceTransparencyChanged`iOS | Fires when the state of the reduce transparency toggle changes. The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when reduce transparency is enabled and `false` otherwise. | \| `screenReaderChanged` | Fires when the state of the screen reader changes. The argument to the event handler is a boolean. The boolean is `true` when a screen reader is enabled and `false` otherwise. |

---

#### `announceForAccessibility()`

```

---

#### `announceForAccessibilityWithOptions()`

```
static announceForAccessibilityWithOptions(
  announcement: string,
  options: options: {queue?: boolean},
);
```

Post a string to be announced by the screen reader with modification options. By default announcements will interrupt any existing speech, but on iOS they can be queued behind existing speech by setting `queue` to `true` in the options object.

**Parameters:**

---

#### `setAccessibilityFocus()`

```
static setAccessibilityFocus(reactTag: number);
```

Set accessibility focus to a React component.

On Android, this calls `UIManager.sendAccessibilityEvent` method with passed `reactTag` and `UIManager.AccessibilityEventTypes.typeViewFocused` arguments.

> **Note**: Make sure that any `View` you want to receive the accessibility focus has `accessible={true}`.

## AppState

`AppState` can tell you if the app is in the foreground or background, and notify you when the state changes.

AppState is frequently used to determine the intent and proper behavior when handling push notifications.

#### App States

- `active` - The app is running in the foreground

- `background` - The app is running in the background. The user is either:

  - in another app
  - on the home screen
  - \[Android] on another `Activity` (even if it was launched by your app)

- \[iOS] `inactive` - This is a state that occurs when transitioning between foreground & background, and during periods of inactivity such as entering the multitasking view, opening the Notification Center or in the event of an incoming call.

For more information, see Apple's documentation

### Basic Usage

To see the current state, you can check `AppState.currentState`, which will be kept up-to-date. However, `currentState` will be null at launch while `AppState` retrieves it over the bridge.

This example will only ever appear to say "Current state is: active" because the app is only visible to the user when in the `active` state, and the null state will happen only momentarily. If you want to experiment with the code we recommend to use your own device instead of embedded preview.

---

### Reference

### Events

#### `change`

This event is received when the app state has changed. The listener is called with one of the current app state values.

#### `memoryWarning`

This event is used in the need of throwing memory warning or releasing it.

#### `focus`Android

Received when the app gains focus (the user is interacting with the app).

#### `blur`Android

Received when the user is not actively interacting with the app. Useful in situations when the user pulls down the notification drawer. `AppState` won't change but the `blur` event will get fired.

### Methods

#### `addEventListener()`

```
static addEventListener(
  type: AppStateEvent,
  listener: (state: AppStateStatus) => void,
): NativeEventSubscription;
```

Sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event type on AppState occurs. Valid values for `eventType` are listed above. Returns the `EventSubscription`.

### Properties

#### `currentState`

```
static currentState: AppStateStatus;
```

## Platform

### Methods

#### `select()`

```
static select(config: Record<string, T>): T;
```

Returns the most fitting value for the platform you are currently running on.

##### Parameters:

| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                   |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| config | object | Yes      | See config description below. |

Select method returns the most fitting value for the platform you are currently running on. That is, if you're running on a phone, `android` and `ios` keys will take preference. If those are not specified, `native` key will be used and then the `default` key.

The `config` parameter is an object with the following keys:

- `android` (any)
- `ios` (any)
- `native` (any)
- `default` (any)

**Example usage:**

```
import {Platform, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    ...Platform.select({
      android: {
        backgroundColor: 'green',
      },
      ios: {
        backgroundColor: 'red',
      },
      default: {
        // other platforms, web for example
        backgroundColor: 'blue',
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

This will result in a container having `flex: 1` on all platforms, a green background color on Android, a red background color on iOS, and a blue background color on other platforms.

Since the value of the corresponding platform key can be of type `any`, `select` method can also be used to return platform-specific components, like below:

```
const Component = Platform.select({
  ios: () => require('ComponentIOS'),
  android: () => require('ComponentAndroid'),
})();

<Component />;
```

```
const Component = Platform.select({
  native: () => require('ComponentForNative'),
  default: () => require('ComponentForWeb'),
})();

<Component />;
```

## Using TypeScript

TypeScript is a language which extends JavaScript by adding type definitions. New React Native projects target TypeScript by default, but also support JavaScript and Flow.

### Getting Started with TypeScript

New projects created by the React Native CLI or popular templates like Ignite will use TypeScript by default.

TypeScript may also be used with Expo, which maintains TypeScript templates, or will prompt you to automatically install and configure TypeScript when a `.ts` or `.tsx` file is added to your project.

shell

```
npx create-expo-app --template
```

### Adding TypeScript to an Existing Project

1. Add TypeScript, types, and ESLint plugins to your project.

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm install -D typescript @react-native/typescript-config @types/jest @types/react @types/react-test-renderer
```

shell

```
yarn add --dev typescript @react-native/typescript-config @types/jest @types/react @types/react-test-renderer
```

note

This command adds the latest version of every dependency. The versions may need to be changed to match the existing packages used by your project. You can use a tool like React Native Upgrade Helper to see the versions shipped by React Native.

2. Add a TypeScript config file. Create a `tsconfig.json` in the root of your project:

tsconfig.json

```
{
  "extends": "@react-native/typescript-config"
}
```

3. Rename a JavaScript file to be `*.tsx`

> You should leave the `./index.js` entrypoint file as it is otherwise you may run into an issue when it comes to bundling a production build.

4. Run `tsc` to type-check your new TypeScript files.

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npx tsc
```

shell

```
yarn tsc
```

### Using JavaScript Instead of TypeScript

React Native defaults new applications to TypeScript, but JavaScript may still be used. Files with a `.jsx` extension are treated as JavaScript instead of TypeScript, and will not be typechecked. JavaScript modules may still be imported by TypeScript modules, along with the reverse.

### How TypeScript and React Native works

Out of the box, TypeScript sources are transformed by Babel during bundling. We recommend that you use the TypeScript compiler only for type checking. This is the default behavior of `tsc` for newly created applications. If you have existing TypeScript code being ported to React Native, there are one or two caveats to using Babel instead of TypeScript.

### What does React Native + TypeScript look like

You can provide an interface for a React Component's Props and State via `React.Component<Props, State>` which will provide type-checking and editor auto-completing when working with that component in JSX.

components/Hello.tsx

```
import {useState} from 'react';
import {Button, StyleSheet, Text, View} from 'react-native';

export type Props = {
  name: string;
  baseEnthusiasmLevel?: number;
};

function Hello({name, baseEnthusiasmLevel = 0}: Props) {
  const [enthusiasmLevel, setEnthusiasmLevel] = useState(
    baseEnthusiasmLevel,
  );

  const onIncrement = () =>
    setEnthusiasmLevel(enthusiasmLevel + 1);
  const onDecrement = () =>
    setEnthusiasmLevel(
      enthusiasmLevel > 0 ? enthusiasmLevel - 1 : 0,
    );

  const getExclamationMarks = (numChars: number) =>
    numChars > 0 ? Array(numChars + 1).join('!') : '';

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.greeting}>
        Hello {name}
        {getExclamationMarks(enthusiasmLevel)}
      </Text>
      <View>
        <Button
          title="Increase enthusiasm"
          accessibilityLabel="increment"
          onPress={onIncrement}
          color="blue"
        />
        <Button
          title="Decrease enthusiasm"
          accessibilityLabel="decrement"
          onPress={onDecrement}
          color="red"
        />
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  greeting: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    margin: 16,
  },
});

export default Hello;
```

You can explore the syntax more in the TypeScript playground.

### Where to Find Useful Advice

- React + TypeScript Cheatsheets has a good overview on how to use React with TypeScript

### Using Custom Path Aliases with TypeScript

To use custom path aliases with TypeScript, you need to set the path aliases to work from both Babel and TypeScript. Here's how:

1. Edit your `tsconfig.json` to have your custom path mappings. Set anything in the root of `src` to be available with no preceding path reference, and allow any test file to be accessed by using `tests/File.tsx`:

diff

```
{
-  "extends": "@react-native/typescript-config"
+  "extends": "@react-native/typescript-config",
+  "compilerOptions": {
+    "baseUrl": ".",
+    "paths": {
+      "*": ["src/*"],
+      "tests": ["tests/*"],
+      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
+    },
+  }
}
```

2. Add `babel-plugin-module-resolver` as a development package to your project:

- npm
- Yarn

shell

```
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-module-resolver
```

shell

```
yarn add --dev babel-plugin-module-resolver
```

3. Finally, configure your `babel.config.js` (note that the syntax for your `babel.config.js` is different from your `tsconfig.json`):

diff

```
{
   presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
+  plugins: [
+    [
+       'module-resolver',
+       {
+         root: ['./src'],
+         extensions: ['.ios.js', '.android.js', '.js', '.ts', '.tsx', '.json'],
+         alias: {
+           tests: ['./tests/'],
+           "@components": "./src/components",
+         }
+       }
+    ]
+  ]
}
```

## SectionList

A performant interface for rendering sectioned lists, supporting the most handy features:

- Fully cross-platform.
- Configurable viewability callbacks.
- List header support.
- List footer support.
- Item separator support.
- Section header support.
- Section separator support.
- Heterogeneous data and item rendering support.
- Pull to Refresh.
- Scroll loading.

If you don't need section support and want a simpler interface, use `<FlatList>`.

### Example

This is a convenience wrapper around `<VirtualizedList>`, and thus inherits its props (as well as those of `<ScrollView>`) that aren't explicitly listed here, along with the following caveats:

- Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.
- This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.
- In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application, and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.
- By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key. Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.

---

### Reference

### Props

#### VirtualizedList Props

Inherits VirtualizedList Props.

---

#### Require&#x64;**`renderItem`**&#x200B;

Default renderer for every item in every section. Can be over-ridden on a per-section basis. Should return a React element.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

The render function will be passed an object with the following keys:

- 'item' (object) - the item object as specified in this section's `data` key

- 'index' (number) - Item's index within the section.

- 'section' (object) - The full section object as specified in `sections`.

- 'separators' (object) - An object with the following keys:

  - 'highlight' (function) - `() => void`

  - 'unhighlight' (function) - `() => void`

  - 'updateProps' (function) - `(select, newProps) => void`

    - 'select' (enum) - possible values are 'leading', 'trailing'
    - 'newProps' (object)

---

#### Require&#x64;**`sections`**&#x200B;

The actual data to render, akin to the `data` prop in `FlatList`.

| Type              |
| ----------------- |
| array of Sections |

---

#### `extraData`

A marker property for telling the list to re-render (since it implements `PureComponent`). If any of your `renderItem`, Header, Footer, etc. functions depend on anything outside of the `data` prop, stick it here and treat it immutably.

| Type |
| ---- |
| any  |

---

#### `initialNumToRender`

How many items to render in the initial batch. This should be enough to fill the screen but not much more. Note these items will never be unmounted as part of the windowed rendering in order to improve perceived performance of scroll-to-top actions.

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| number | `10`    |

---

#### `inverted`

Reverses the direction of scroll. Uses scale transforms of -1.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | `false` |

---

#### `ItemSeparatorComponent`

Rendered in between each item, but not at the top or bottom. By default, `highlighted`, `section`, and `[leading/trailing][Item/Section]` props are provided. `renderItem` provides `separators.highlight`/`unhighlight` which will update the `highlighted` prop, but you can also add custom props with `separators.updateProps`. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type                         |
| ---------------------------- |
| component, function, element |

---

#### `keyExtractor`

Used to extract a unique key for a given item at the specified index. Key is used for caching and as the React key to track item re-ordering. The default extractor checks `item.key`, then `item.id`, and then falls back to using the index, like React does. Note that this sets keys for each item, but each overall section still needs its own key.

| Type                                    |
| --------------------------------------- |
| (item: object, index: number) => string |

---

#### `ListEmptyComponent`

Rendered when the list is empty. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `ListFooterComponent`

Rendered at the very end of the list. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `ListHeaderComponent`

Rendered at the very beginning of the list. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `onRefresh`

If provided, a standard RefreshControl will be added for "Pull to Refresh" functionality. Make sure to also set the `refreshing` prop correctly. To offset the RefreshControl from the top (e.g. by 100 pts), use `progressViewOffset={100}`.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `onViewableItemsChanged`

Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the `viewabilityConfig` prop.

| Type                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `(callback: {changed: ViewToken[], viewableItems: ViewToken[]}) => void` |

---

#### `refreshing`

Set this true while waiting for new data from a refresh.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | `false` |

---

#### `removeClippedSubviews`

This may improve scroll performance for large lists.

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | `false` |

---

#### `renderSectionFooter`

Rendered at the bottom of each section.

| Type                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------- |
| `(info: {section: Section}) => element ｜ null` |

---

#### `renderSectionHeader`

Rendered at the top of each section. These stick to the top of the `ScrollView` by default on iOS. See `stickySectionHeadersEnabled`.

| Type                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------- |
| `(info: {section: Section}) => element ｜ null` |

---

#### `SectionSeparatorComponent`

Rendered at the top and bottom of each section (note this is different from `ItemSeparatorComponent` which is only rendered between items). These are intended to separate sections from the headers above and below and typically have the same highlight response as `ItemSeparatorComponent`. Also receives `highlighted`, `[leading/trailing][Item/Section]`, and any custom props from `separators.updateProps`.

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `stickySectionHeadersEnabled`

Makes section headers stick to the top of the screen until the next one pushes it off. Only enabled by default on iOS because that is the platform standard there.

| Type    | Default                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| boolean | `false`Android\*\*\*`true`iOS |

### Methods

#### `flashScrollIndicators()`iOS

```
flashScrollIndicators();
```

Displays the scroll indicators momentarily.

---

#### `recordInteraction()`

```
recordInteraction();
```

Tells the list an interaction has occurred, which should trigger viewability calculations, e.g. if `waitForInteractions` is true and the user has not scrolled. This is typically called by taps on items or by navigation actions.

---

#### `scrollToLocation()`

```
scrollToLocation(params: SectionListScrollParams);
```

Scrolls to the item at the specified `sectionIndex` and `itemIndex` (within the section) positioned in the viewable area such that `viewPosition` 0 places it at the top (and may be covered by a sticky header), 1 at the bottom, and 0.5 centered in the middle.

> Note: Cannot scroll to locations outside the render window without specifying the `getItemLayout` or `onScrollToIndexFailed` prop.

**Parameters:**

| Name           | Type   |
| -------------- | ------ |
| paramsRequired | object |

Valid `params` keys are:

- 'animated' (boolean) - Whether the list should do an animation while scrolling. Defaults to `true`.
- 'itemIndex' (number) - Index within section for the item to scroll to. Required.
- 'sectionIndex' (number) - Index for section that contains the item to scroll to. Required.
- 'viewOffset' (number) - A fixed number of pixels to offset the final target position, e.g. to compensate for sticky headers.
- 'viewPosition' (number) - A value of `0` places the item specified by index at the top, `1` at the bottom, and `0.5` centered in the middle.

### Type Definitions

#### Section

An object that identifies the data to be rendered for a given section.

| Type |
| ---- |
| any  |

**Properties:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dataRequired | array | The data for rendering items in this section. Array of objects, much like `FlatList`'s data prop. |
| key | string | Optional key to keep track of section re-ordering. If you don't plan on re-ordering sections, the array index will be used by default. |
| renderItem | function | Optionally define an arbitrary item renderer for this section, overriding the default `renderItem` for the list. |
| ItemSeparatorComponent | component, element | Optionally define an arbitrary item separator for this section, overriding the default `ItemSeparatorComponent` for the list. |
| keyExtractor | function | Optionally define an arbitrary key extractor for this section, overriding the default `keyExtractor`. |

## RootTag

`RootTag` is an opaque identifier assigned to the native root view of your React Native surface — i.e. the `ReactRootView` or `RCTRootView` instance for Android or iOS respectively. In short, it is a surface identifier.

### When to use a RootTag?

For most React Native developers, you likely won’t need to deal with `RootTag`s.

`RootTag`s are useful for when an app renders **multiple React Native root views** and you need to handle native API calls differently depending on the surface. An example of this is when an app is using native navigation and each screen is a separate React Native root view.

In native navigation, every React Native root view is rendered in a platform’s navigation view (e.g., `Activity` for Android, `UINavigationViewController` for iOS). By this, you are able to leverage the navigation paradigms of the platform such as native look and feel and navigation transitions. The functionality to interact with the native navigation APIs can be exposed to React Native via a native module.

For example, to update the title bar of a screen, you would call the navigation module’s API `setTitle("Updated Title")`, but it would need to know which screen in the stack to update. A `RootTag` is necessary here to identify the root view and its hosting container.

Another use case for `RootTag` is when your app needs to attribute a certain JavaScript call to native based on its originating root view. A `RootTag` is necessary to differentiate the source of the call from different surfaces.

### How to access the RootTag... if you need it

In versions 0.65 and below, RootTag is accessed via a legacy context. To prepare React Native for Concurrent features coming in React 18 and beyond, we are migrating to the latest Context API via `RootTagContext` in 0.66. Version 0.65 supports both the legacy context and the recommended `RootTagContext` to allow developers time to migrate their call-sites. See the breaking changes summary.

How to access `RootTag` via the `RootTagContext`.

js

```
import {RootTagContext} from 'react-native';
import NativeAnalytics from 'native-analytics';
import NativeNavigation from 'native-navigation';

function ScreenA() {
  const rootTag = useContext(RootTagContext);

  const updateTitle = title => {
    NativeNavigation.setTitle(rootTag, title);
  };

  const handleOneEvent = () => {
    NativeAnalytics.logEvent(rootTag, 'one_event');
  };

  // ...
}

class ScreenB extends React.Component {
  static contextType: typeof RootTagContext = RootTagContext;

  updateTitle(title) {
    NativeNavigation.setTitle(this.context, title);
  }

  handleOneEvent() {
    NativeAnalytics.logEvent(this.context, 'one_event');
  }

  // ...
}
```

Learn more about the Context API for classes and hooks from the React docs.

#### Breaking Change in 0.65

`RootTagContext` was formerly named `unstable_RootTagContext` and changed to `RootTagContext` in 0.65. Please update any usages of `unstable_RootTagContext` in your codebase.

#### Breaking Change in 0.66

The legacy context access to `RootTag` will be removed and replaced by `RootTagContext`. Beginning in 0.65, we encourage developers to proactively migrate `RootTag` accesses to `RootTagContext`.

### Future Plans

With the new React Native architecture progressing, there will be future iterations to `RootTag`, with the intention to keep the `RootTag` type opaque and prevent thrash in React Native codebases. Please do not rely on the fact that RootTag currently aliases to a number! If your app relies on RootTags, keep an eye on our version change logs, which you can find here.

## DevSettings

The `DevSettings` module exposes methods for customizing settings for developers in development.

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `addMenuItem()`

```
static addMenuItem(title: string, handler: () => any);
```

Add a custom menu item to the Dev Menu.

**Parameters:**

| Name            | Type     |
| --------------- | -------- |
| titleRequired   | string   |
| handlerRequired | function |

**Example:**

```
DevSettings.addMenuItem('Show Secret Dev Screen', () => {
  Alert.alert('Showing secret dev screen!');
});
```

---

#### `reload()`

```

- -
  -

## Share

### Example

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

### Reference

### Methods

```
static share(content: ShareContent, options?: ShareOptions);
```

Open a dialog to share text content.

In iOS, returns a Promise which will be invoked with an object containing `action` and `activityType`. If the user dismissed the dialog, the Promise will still be resolved with action being `Share.dismissedAction` and all the other keys being undefined. Note that some share options will not appear or work on the iOS simulator.

In Android, returns a Promise which will always be resolved with action being `Share.sharedAction`.

**Properties:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contentRequired | object | `message` - a message to share `url` - a URL to shareiOS `title` - title of the messageAndroid\*\*\*At least one of `url` and `message` is required. |
| options | object | `dialogTitle`Android `excludedActivityTypes`iOS `subject` - a subject to share via emailiOS `tintColor`iOS `anchor` - the node to which the action sheet should be anchored (used for iPad)iOS |

---

### Properties

#### `sharedAction`

```
static sharedAction: 'sharedAction';
```

The content was successfully shared.

---

#### `dismissedAction`iOS

```
static dismissedAction: 'dismissedAction';
```

The dialog has been dismissed.

## VirtualizedList

Base implementation for the more convenient `<FlatList>` and `<SectionList>` components, which are also better documented. In general, this should only really be used if you need more flexibility than `FlatList` provides, e.g. for use with immutable data instead of plain arrays.

Virtualization massively improves memory consumption and performance of large lists by maintaining a finite render window of active items and replacing all items outside of the render window with appropriately sized blank space. The window adapts to scrolling behavior, and items are rendered incrementally with low-pri (after any running interactions) if they are far from the visible area, or with hi-pri otherwise to minimize the potential of seeing blank space.

### Example

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

---

Some caveats:

- Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.
- This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` are shallow-equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.
- In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application, and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.
- By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key. Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.

---

### Reference

### Props

#### ScrollView Props

Inherits ScrollView Props.

---

#### `data`

#### Require&#x64;**`getItem`**&#x200B;

```
(data: any, index: number) => any;
```

A generic accessor for extracting an item from any sort of data blob.

| Type     |

#### Require&#x64;**`renderItem`**&#x200B;

```
(info: any) => ?React.Element<any>
```

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `CellRendererComponent`

CellRendererComponent allows customizing how cells rendered by `renderItem`/`ListItemComponent` are wrapped when placed into the underlying ScrollView. This component must accept event handlers which notify VirtualizedList of changes within the cell.

| Type                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| `React.ComponentType<CellRendererProps>` |

---

#### `ItemSeparatorComponent`

Rendered in between each item, but not at the top or bottom. By default, `highlighted` and `leadingItem` props are provided. `renderItem` provides `separators.highlight`/`unhighlight` which will update the `highlighted` prop, but you can also add custom props with `separators.updateProps`. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type                         |
| ---------------------------- |
| component, function, element |

---

#### `ListEmptyComponent`

Rendered when the list is empty. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `ListItemComponent`

Each data item is rendered using this element. Can be a React Component Class, or a render function.

| Type                |
| ------------------- |
| component, function |

---

#### `ListFooterComponent`

Rendered at the bottom of all the items. Can be a React Component (e.g. `SomeComponent`), or a React element (e.g. `<SomeComponent />`).

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `ListFooterComponentStyle`

Styling for internal View for `ListFooterComponent`.

| Type          | Required |
| ------------- | -------- |
| ViewStyleProp | No       |

---

#### `ListHeaderComponent`

| ------------------ |
| component, element |

---

#### `ListHeaderComponentStyle`

Styling for internal View for `ListHeaderComponent`.

| Type |
| ---- |
|      |

---

#### `debug`

`debug` will turn on extra logging and visual overlays to aid with debugging both usage and implementation, but with a significant perf hit.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `disableVirtualization`

> **Deprecated.** Virtualization provides significant performance and memory optimizations, but fully unmounts react instances that are outside of the render window. You should only need to disable this for debugging purposes.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `extraData`

A marker property for telling the list to re-render (since it implements `PureComponent`). If any of your `renderItem`, Header, Footer, etc. functions depend on anything outside of the `data` prop, stick it here and treat it immutably.

| Type |
| ---- |
| any  |

---

#### `getItemLayout`

```
(
  data: any,
  index: number,
) => {length: number, offset: number, index: number}
```

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `horizontal`

If `true`, renders items next to each other horizontally instead of stacked vertically.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `initialNumToRender`

How many items to render in the initial batch. This should be enough to fill the screen but not much more. Note these items will never be unmounted as part of the windowed rendering in order to improve perceived performance of scroll-to-top actions.

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| number | `10`    |

---

#### `initialScrollIndex`

Instead of starting at the top with the first item, start at `initialScrollIndex`. This disables the "scroll to top" optimization that keeps the first `initialNumToRender` items always rendered and immediately renders the items starting at this initial index. Requires `getItemLayout` to be implemented.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `inverted`

Reverses the direction of scroll. Uses scale transforms of `-1`.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `keyExtractor`

```
(item: any, index: number) => string;
```

Used to extract a unique key for a given item at the specified index. Key is used for caching and as the react key to track item re-ordering. The default extractor checks `item.key`, then `item.id`, and then falls back to using the index, like React does.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `maxToRenderPerBatch`

The maximum number of items to render in each incremental render batch. The more rendered at once, the better the fill rate, but responsiveness may suffer because rendering content may interfere with responding to button taps or other interactions.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `onEndReached`

Called once when the scroll position gets within `onEndReachedThreshold` from the logical end of the list.

| Type                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- |
| `(info: {distanceFromEnd: number}) => void` |

---

#### `onEndReachedThreshold`

How far from the end (in units of visible length of the list) the trailing edge of the list must be from the end of the content to trigger the `onEndReached` callback. Thus, a value of 0.5 will trigger `onEndReached` when the end of the content is within half the visible length of the list.

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| number | `2`     |

---

#### `onRefresh`

```
() => void;
```

If provided, a standard `RefreshControl` will be added for "Pull to Refresh" functionality. Make sure to also set the `refreshing` prop correctly.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `onScrollToIndexFailed`

```
(info: {
  index: number,
  highestMeasuredFrameIndex: number,
  averageItemLength: number,
}) => void;
```

Used to handle failures when scrolling to an index that has not been measured yet. Recommended action is to either compute your own offset and `scrollTo` it, or scroll as far as possible and then try again after more items have been rendered.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `onStartReached`

Called once when the scroll position gets within `onStartReachedThreshold` from the logical start of the list.

| Type                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- |
| `(info: {distanceFromStart: number}) => void` |

---

#### `onStartReachedThreshold`

How far from the start (in units of visible length of the list) the leading edge of the list must be from the start of the content to trigger the `onStartReached` callback. Thus, a value of 0.5 will trigger `onStartReached` when the start of the content is within half the visible length of the list.

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| number | `2`     |

---

#### `onViewableItemsChanged`

Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the `viewabilityConfig` prop.

| Type                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `(callback: {changed: ViewToken[], viewableItems: ViewToken[]}) => void` |

---

#### `persistentScrollbar`

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

---

#### `progressViewOffset`

Set this when offset is needed for the loading indicator to show correctly.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `refreshControl`

A custom refresh control element. When set, it overrides the default `<RefreshControl>` component built internally. The onRefresh and refreshing props are also ignored. Only works for vertical VirtualizedList.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| element |

---

#### `refreshing`

Set this true while waiting for new data from a refresh.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `removeClippedSubviews`

This may improve scroll performance for large lists.

> Note: May have bugs (missing content) in some circumstances - use at your own risk.

| Type    |
| ------- |
| boolean |

---

#### `renderScrollComponent`

```
(props: object) => element;
```

Render a custom scroll component, e.g. with a differently styled `RefreshControl`.

| Type     |
| -------- |
| function |

---

#### `viewabilityConfig`

See `ViewabilityHelper.js` for flow type and further documentation.

| Type              |
| ----------------- |
| ViewabilityConfig |

---

#### `viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs`

List of `ViewabilityConfig`/`onViewableItemsChanged` pairs. A specific `onViewableItemsChanged` will be called when its corresponding `ViewabilityConfig`'s conditions are met. See `ViewabilityHelper.js` for flow type and further documentation.

| Type                                   |
| -------------------------------------- |
| array of ViewabilityConfigCallbackPair |

---

#### `updateCellsBatchingPeriod`

Amount of time between low-pri item render batches, e.g. for rendering items quite a ways off screen. Similar fill rate/responsiveness tradeoff as `maxToRenderPerBatch`.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---

#### `windowSize`

Determines the maximum number of items rendered outside of the visible area, in units of visible lengths. So if your list fills the screen, then `windowSize={21}` (the default) will render the visible screen area plus up to 10 screens above and 10 below the viewport. Reducing this number will reduce memory consumption and may improve performance, but will increase the chance that fast scrolling may reveal momentary blank areas of unrendered content.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

### Methods

#### `flashScrollIndicators()`

```
flashScrollIndicators();
```

---

#### `getScrollableNode()`

```
getScrollableNode(): any;
```

---

#### `getScrollRef()`

```
getScrollRef():
  | React.ElementRef<typeof ScrollView>
  | React.ElementRef<typeof View>
  | null;
```

---

#### `getScrollResponder()`

```
getScrollResponder () => ScrollResponderMixin | null;
```

Provides a handle to the underlying scroll responder. Note that `this._scrollRef` might not be a `ScrollView`, so we need to check that it responds to `getScrollResponder` before calling it.

---

#### `scrollToEnd()`

```
scrollToEnd(params?: {animated?: boolean});
```

Scrolls to the end of the content. May be janky without `getItemLayout` prop.

**Parameters:**

| Name   | Type   |
| ------ | ------ |
| params | object |

Valid `params` keys are:

- `'animated'` (boolean) - Whether the list should do an animation while scrolling. Defaults to `true`.

---

#### `scrollToIndex()`

```
scrollToIndex(params: {
  index: number;
  animated?: boolean;
  viewOffset?: number;
  viewPosition?: number;
});
```

Valid `params` consist of:

- 'index' (number). Required.
- 'animated' (boolean). Optional.
- 'viewOffset' (number). Optional.
- 'viewPosition' (number). Optional.

---

#### `scrollToItem()`

```
scrollToItem(params: {
  item: ItemT;
  animated?: boolean;
  viewOffset?: number;
  viewPosition?: number;
);
```

Valid `params` consist of:

- 'item' (Item). Required.
- 'animated' (boolean). Optional.
- 'viewOffset' (number). Optional.
- 'viewPosition' (number). Optional.

---

#### `scrollToOffset()`

```
scrollToOffset(params: {
  offset: number;
  animated?: boolean;
});
```

Scroll to a specific content pixel offset in the list.

Param `offset` expects the offset to scroll to. In case of `horizontal` is true, the offset is the x-value, in any other case the offset is the y-value.

Param `animated` (`true` by default) defines whether the list should do an animation while scrolling.

## StyleSheet

A StyleSheet is an abstraction similar to CSS StyleSheets.

Code quality tips:

- By moving styles away from the render function, you're making the code easier to understand.
- Naming the styles is a good way to add meaning to the low level components in the render function, and encourage reuse.
- In most IDEs, using `StyleSheet.create()` will offer static type checking and suggestions to help you write valid styles.

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `compose()`

```
static compose(style1: Object, style2: Object): Object | Object[];
```

Combines two styles such that `style2` will override any styles in `style1`. If either style is falsy, the other one is returned without allocating an array, saving allocations and maintaining reference equality for PureComponent checks.

---

#### `create()`

```
static create(styles: Object extends Record<string, ViewStyle | ImageStyle | TextStyle>): Object;
```

An identity function for creating styles. The main practical benefit of creating styles inside `StyleSheet.create()` is static type checking against native style properties.

---

#### `flatten()`

```
static flatten(style: Array<Object extends Record<string, ViewStyle | ImageStyle | TextStyle>>): Object;
```

Flattens an array of style objects, into one aggregated style object.

---

#### `setStyleAttributePreprocessor()`

> **WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL.** Breaking changes will probably happen a lot and will not be reliably announced. The whole thing might be deleted, who knows? Use at your own risk.

```
static setStyleAttributePreprocessor(
  property: string,
  process: (propValue: any) => any,
);
```

Sets a function to use to pre-process a style property value. This is used internally to process color and transform values. You should not use this unless you really know what you are doing and have exhausted other options.

### Properties

---

#### `absoluteFill`

A very common pattern is to create overlays with position absolute and zero positioning (`position: 'absolute', left: 0, right: 0, top: 0, bottom: 0`), so `absoluteFill` can be used for convenience and to reduce duplication of these repeated styles. If you want, absoluteFill can be used to create a customized entry in a StyleSheet, e.g.:

---

#### `absoluteFillObject`

Sometimes you may want `absoluteFill` but with a couple tweaks - `absoluteFillObject` can be used to create a customized entry in a `StyleSheet`, e.g.:

---

#### `hairlineWidth`

This is defined as the width of a thin line on the platform. It can be used as the thickness of a border or division between two elements. Example:

This constant will always be a round number of pixels (so a line defined by it can look crisp) and will try to match the standard width of a thin line on the underlying platform. However, you should not rely on it being a constant size, because on different platforms and screen densities its value may be calculated differently.

A line with hairline width may not be visible if your simulator is downscaled.

## Animated.Value

Standard value for driving animations. One `Animated.Value` can drive multiple properties in a synchronized fashion, but can only be driven by one mechanism at a time. Using a new mechanism (e.g. starting a new animation, or calling `setValue`) will stop any previous ones.

Typically initialized with `useAnimatedValue(0);` or `new Animated.Value(0);` in class components.

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `setValue()`

```
setValue(value: number);
```

Directly set the value. This will stop any animations running on the value and update all the bound properties.

**Parameters:**

| Name  | Type   | Required | Description |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| value | number | Yes      | Value       |

---

#### `setOffset()`

```
setOffset(offset: number);
```

Sets an offset that is applied on top of whatever value is set, whether via `setValue`, an animation, or `Animated.event`. Useful for compensating things like the start of a pan gesture.

**Parameters:**

| Name   | Type   | Required | Description  |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------ |
| offset | number | Yes      | Offset value |

---

#### `flattenOffset()`

```
flattenOffset();
```

Merges the offset value into the base value and resets the offset to zero. The final output of the value is unchanged.

---

#### `extractOffset()`

```
extractOffset();
```

Sets the offset value to the base value, and resets the base value to zero. The final output of the value is unchanged.

---

#### `addListener()`

```
addListener(callback: (state: {value: number}) => void): string;
```

Adds an asynchronous listener to the value so you can observe updates from animations. This is useful because there is no way to synchronously read the value because it might be driven natively.

Returns a string that serves as an identifier for the listener.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| callback | function | Yes | The callback function which will receive an object with a `value` key set to the new value. |

---

#### `removeAllListeners()`

```
removeAllListeners();
```

Remove all registered listeners.

---

#### `stopAnimation()`

```
stopAnimation(callback?: (value: number) => void);
```

Stops any running animation or tracking. `callback` is invoked with the final value after stopping the animation, which is useful for updating state to match the animation position with layout.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| callback | function | No | A function that will receive the final value. |

---

#### `resetAnimation()`

## Dimensions

> `useWindowDimensions` is the preferred API for React components. Unlike `Dimensions`, it updates as the window's dimensions update. This works nicely with the React paradigm.

```
import {Dimensions} from 'react-native';
```

You can get the application window's width and height using the following code:

```
const windowWidth = Dimensions.get('window').width;
const windowHeight = Dimensions.get('window').height;
```

> Although dimensions are available immediately, they may change (e.g due to device rotation, foldable devices etc) so any rendering logic or styles that depend on these constants should try to call this function on every render, rather than caching the value (for example, using inline styles rather than setting a value in a `StyleSheet`).

If you are targeting foldable devices or devices which can change the screen size or app window size, you can use the event listener available in the Dimensions module as shown in the below example.

### Example

### Reference

### Methods

#### `addEventListener()`

```
static addEventListener(
  type: 'change',
  handler: ({
    window,
    screen,
  }: DimensionsValue) => void,
): EmitterSubscription;
```

Add an event handler. Supported events:

- `change`: Fires when a property within the `Dimensions` object changes. The argument to the event handler is a `DimensionsValue` type object.

---

#### `get()`

```
static get(dim: 'window' | 'screen'): ScaledSize;
```

Initial dimensions are set before `runApplication` is called so they should be available before any other require's are run, but may be updated later.

Example: `const {height, width} = Dimensions.get('window');`

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dimRequired | string | Name of dimension as defined when calling `set`. Returns value for the dimension. |

> For Android the `window` dimension will exclude the size used by the `status bar` (if not translucent) and `bottom navigation bar`

---

### Type Definitions

#### DimensionsValue

**Properties:**

| Name   | Type | Description                             |
| ------ | ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| window |      | Size of the visible Application window. |
| screen |      | Size of the device's screen.            |

#### ScaledSize

| Type   |
| ------ |
| object |

**Properties:**

| Name      | Type   |
| --------- | ------ |
| width     | number |
| height    | number |
| scale     | number |
| fontScale | number |

## Systrace

`Systrace` is a standard Android marker-based profiling tool (and is installed when you install the Android platform-tools package). Profiled code blocks are surrounded by start/end markers which are then visualized in a colorful chart format. Both the Android SDK and React Native framework provide standard markers that you can visualize.

### Example

`Systrace` allows you to mark JavaScript (JS) events with a tag and an integer value. Capture the non-Timed JS events in EasyProfiler.

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `isEnabled()`

```
static isEnabled(): boolean;
```

---

#### `beginEvent()`

```
static beginEvent(eventName: string | (() => string), args?: EventArgs);
```

beginEvent/endEvent for starting and then ending a profile within the same call stack frame.

---

#### `endEvent()`

```
static endEvent(args?: EventArgs);
```

---

#### `beginAsyncEvent()`

```
static beginAsyncEvent(
  eventName: string | (() => string),
  args?: EventArgs,
): number;
```

beginAsyncEvent/endAsyncEvent for starting and then ending a profile where the end can either occur on another thread or out of the current stack frame, eg await the returned cookie variable should be used as input into the endAsyncEvent call to end the profile.

---

#### `endAsyncEvent()`

```
static endAsyncEvent(
  eventName: EventName,
  cookie: number,
  args?: EventArgs,
);
```

---

#### `counterEvent()`

```

## React Node Object Type

A React Node is one of the following types:

- Boolean (which is ignored)
- `null` or `undefined` (which is ignored)
- Number
- String
- A React element (result of JSX)
- An array of any of the above, possibly a nested one

## Easing

The `Easing` module implements common easing functions. This module is used by `Animated.timing()` to convey physically believable motion in animations.

You can find a visualization of some common easing functions at <https://easings.net/>

#### Predefined animations

The `Easing` module provides several predefined animations through the following methods:

- `back` provides a basic animation where the object goes slightly back before moving forward
- `bounce` provides a bouncing animation
- `ease` provides a basic inertial animation
- `elastic` provides a basic spring interaction

#### Standard functions

Three standard easing functions are provided:

-
-
-

The `poly` function can be used to implement quartic, quintic, and other higher power functions.

#### Additional functions

Additional mathematical functions are provided by the following methods:

- `bezier` provides a cubic bezier curve
- `circle` provides a circular function
- `sin` provides a sinusoidal function
- `exp` provides an exponential function

The following helpers are used to modify other easing functions.

- `in` runs an easing function forwards
- `inOut` makes any easing function symmetrical
- `out` runs an easing function backwards

### Example

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `step0()`

```
static step0(n: number);
```

A stepping function, returns 1 for any positive value of `n`.

---

#### `step1()`

```
static step1(n: number);
```

A stepping function, returns 1 if `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

---

#### `linear()`

```
static linear(t: number);
```

A linear function, `f(t) = t`. Position correlates to elapsed time one to one.

---

#### `ease()`

```
static ease(t: number);
```

A basic inertial interaction, similar to an object slowly accelerating to speed.

---

#### `quad()`

```
static quad(t: number);
```

A quadratic function, `f(t) = t * t`. Position equals the square of elapsed time.

---

#### `cubic()`

```
static cubic(t: number);
```

A cubic function, `f(t) = t * t * t`. Position equals the cube of elapsed time.

---

#### `poly()`

```
static poly(n: number);
```

A power function. Position is equal to the Nth power of elapsed time.

n = 4: <https://easings.net/#easeInQuart> n = 5: <https://easings.net/#easeInQuint>

---

#### `sin()`

```
static sin(t: number);
```

A sinusoidal function.

---

#### `circle()`

```
static circle(t: number);
```

A circular function.

---

#### `exp()`

```
static exp(t: number);
```

An exponential function.

---

#### `elastic()`

```
static elastic(bounciness: number);
```

A basic elastic interaction, similar to a spring oscillating back and forth.

Default bounciness is 1, which overshoots a little bit once. 0 bounciness doesn't overshoot at all, and bounciness of N > 1 will overshoot about N times.

---

#### `back()`

```
static back(s)
```

Use with `Animated.parallel()` to create a basic effect where the object animates back slightly as the animation starts.

---

#### `bounce()`

```
static bounce(t: number);
```

Provides a basic bouncing effect.

---

#### `bezier()`

```
static bezier(x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number);
```

Provides a cubic bezier curve, equivalent to CSS Transitions' `transition-timing-function`.

A useful tool to visualize cubic bezier curves can be found at <https://cubic-bezier.com/>

---

#### `in()`

```
static in(easing: number);
```

Runs an easing function forwards.

---

#### `out()`

```
static out(easing: number);
```

Runs an easing function backwards.

---

#### `inOut()`

```
static inOut(easing: number);
```

Makes any easing function symmetrical. The easing function will run forwards for half of the duration, then backwards for the rest of the duration.

## Props

Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters. These created parameters are called `props`, short for properties.

For example, one basic React Native component is the `Image`. When you create an image, you can use a prop named `source` to control what image it shows.

Notice the braces surrounding `{pic}` - these embed the variable `pic` into JSX. You can put any JavaScript expression inside braces in JSX.

Your own components can also use `props`. This lets you make a single component that is used in many different places in your app, with slightly different properties in each place by referring to `props` in your `render` function. Here's an example:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

Using `name` as a prop lets us customize the `Greeting` component, so we can reuse that component for each of our greetings. This example also uses the `Greeting` component in JSX, similar to the Core Components. The power to do this is what makes React so cool - if you find yourself wishing that you had a different set of UI primitives to work with, you can invent new ones.

The other new thing going on here is the `View` component. A `View` is useful as a container for other components, to help control style and layout.

With `props` and the basic `Text`, `Image`, and `View` components, you can build a wide variety of static screens. To learn how to make your app change over time, you need to learn about State.

## Vibration

Vibrates the device.

### Example

> Android apps should request the `android.permission.VIBRATE` permission by adding `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>` to `AndroidManifest.xml`.

> The Vibration API is implemented as a `AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate)` call on iOS.

---

### Reference

### Methods

#### `cancel()`

```
static cancel();
```

Call this to stop vibrating after having invoked `vibrate()` with repetition enabled.

---

#### `vibrate()`

```
static vibrate(
  pattern?: number | number[],
  repeat?: boolean
);
```

Triggers a vibration with a fixed duration.

**On Android,** the vibration duration defaults to 400 milliseconds, and an arbitrary vibration duration can be specified by passing a number as the value for the `pattern` argument. **On iOS,** the vibration duration is fixed at roughly 400 milliseconds.

The `vibrate()` method can take a `pattern` argument with an array of numbers that represent time in milliseconds. You may set `repeat` to true to run through the vibration pattern in a loop until `cancel()` is called.

**On Android,** the odd indices of the `pattern` array represent the vibration duration, while the even ones represent the separation time. **On iOS,** the numbers in the `pattern` array represent the separation time, as the vibration duration is fixed.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pattern | numberAndroid\*\*\*array of numbers | `400` | Vibration duration in milliseconds.\*\*\*Vibration pattern as an array of numbers in milliseconds. |
| repeat | boolean | `false` | Repeat vibration pattern until `cancel()`. |

## Animated.ValueXY

## useColorScheme

```
import {useColorScheme} from 'react-native';
```

The `useColorScheme` React hook provides and subscribes to color scheme updates from the `Appearance` module. The return value indicates the current user preferred color scheme. The value may be updated later, either through direct user action (e.g. theme selection in device settings) or on a schedule (e.g. light and dark themes that follow the day/night cycle).

#### Supported color schemes

- `"light"`: The user prefers a light color theme.
- `"dark"`: The user prefers a dark color theme.
- `null`: The user has not indicated a preferred color theme.

---

### Example

You can find a complete example that demonstrates the use of this hook alongside a React context to add support for light and dark themes to your application in `AppearanceExample.js`.

On this page

## useWindowDimensions

```
import {useWindowDimensions} from 'react-native';
