**React Native allows developers who know React to create native apps.** At the same time, native developers can use React Native to gain parity between native platforms by writing common features once.

We believe that the best way to experience React Native is through a **Framework**, a toolbox with all the necessary APIs to let you build production ready apps.

You can also use React Native without a Framework, however we’ve found that most developers benefit from using a React Native Framework like Expo. Expo provides features like file-based routing, high-quality universal libraries, and the ability to write plugins that modify native code without having to manage native files.

Expo is a production-grade React Native Framework. Expo provides developer tooling that makes developing apps easier, such as file-based routing, a standard library of native modules, and much more.

Expo's Framework is free and open source, with an active community on GitHub and Discord. The Expo team works in close collaboration with the React Native team at Meta to bring the latest React Native features to the Expo SDK.

The team at Expo also provides Expo Application Services (EAS), an optional set of services that complements Expo, the Framework, in each step of the development process.

To create a new Expo project, run the following in your terminal:

shell

```
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

Once you’ve created your app, check out the rest of Expo’s getting started guide to start developing your app.
