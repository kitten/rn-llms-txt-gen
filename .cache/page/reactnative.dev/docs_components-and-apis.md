# Core Components and APIs

React Native provides a number of built-in Core Components ready for you to use in your app. You can find them all in the left sidebar (or menu above, if you are on a narrow screen). If you're not sure where to get started, take a look at the following categories:

* Basic Components
* User Interface
* List Views
* Android-specific
* iOS-specific
* Others

You're not limited to the components and APIs bundled with React Native. React Native has a community of thousands of developers. If you're looking for a library that does something specific, please refer to this guide about finding libraries.

## Basic Components

Most apps will end up using one or more of these basic components.

## User Interface

These common user interface controls will render on any platform.

## List Views

Unlike the more generic `ScrollView`, the following list view components only render elements that are currently showing on the screen. This makes them a performant choice for displaying long lists of data.

## Android Components and APIs

Many of the following components provide wrappers for commonly used Android classes.

## iOS Components and APIs

Many of the following components provide wrappers for commonly used UIKit classes.

## Others

These components may be useful for certain applications. For an exhaustive list of components and APIs, check out the sidebar to the left (or menu above, if you are on a narrow screen).
