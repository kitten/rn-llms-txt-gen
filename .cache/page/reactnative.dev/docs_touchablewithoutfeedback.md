# TouchableWithoutFeedback

> If you're looking for a more extensive and future-proof way to handle touch-based input, check out the Pressable API.

Do not use unless you have a very good reason. All elements that respond to press should have a visual feedback when touched.

`TouchableWithoutFeedback` supports only one child. If you wish to have several child components, wrap them in a View. Importantly, `TouchableWithoutFeedback` works by cloning its child and applying responder props to it. It is therefore required that any intermediary components pass through those props to the underlying React Native component.

## Usage Pattern

```
function MyComponent(props: MyComponentProps) {
  return (
    <View {...props} style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#fff'}}>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

<TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>
  <MyComponent />
</TouchableWithoutFeedback>;
```

## Props

### `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`iOS

A value indicating this view should or should not be inverted when color inversion is turned on. A value of `true` will tell the view to not be inverted even if color inversion is turned on.

When `true`, indicates that the view is an accessibility element. By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.

* Type
  bool

  string

### `accessibilityRole`

`accessibilityRole` communicates the purpose of a component to the user of an assistive technology.

`accessibilityRole` can be one of the following:

  string

### `accessibilityState`

Describes the current state of a component to the user of an assistive technology.

See the Accessibility guide for more information.

* Type
  object: 
  `{disabled: bool, selected: bool, checked: bool or 'mixed', busy: bool, expanded: bool}`

### `accessibilityActions`

Accessibility actions allow an assistive technology to programmatically invoke the actions of a component. The `accessibilityActions` property should contain a list of action objects. Each action object should contain the field name and label.

See the Accessibility guide for more information.

* Type
  array

### `aria-busy`

Indicates an element is being modified and that assistive technologies may want to wait until the changes are complete before informing the user about the update.

* Type
  boolean

* Type
  boolean, 'mixed'
* Default
  false

### `aria-disabled`

Indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable.

* Type
  boolean
* Default
  false

### `aria-expanded`

Indicates whether an expandable element is currently expanded or collapsed.

* Type
  boolean
* Default
  false

### `aria-hidden`

Indicates whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element are hidden.

For example, in a window that contains sibling views `A` and `B`, setting `aria-hidden` to `true` on view `B` causes VoiceOver to ignore the elements in the view `B`.

* Type
  boolean
* Default
  false

### `aria-label`

Defines a string value that labels an interactive element.

* Type
  string

### `aria-live`Android

* **off** Accessibility services should not announce changes to this view.
* **polite** Accessibility services should announce changes to this view.
* **assertive** Accessibility services should interrupt ongoing speech to immediately announce changes to this view.

  enum(
  `'assertive'`
  , 
  `'off'`
  , 
  `'polite'`
