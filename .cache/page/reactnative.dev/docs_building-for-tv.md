# Building For TV Devices

TV devices support has been implemented with the intention of making existing React Native applications work on Apple TV and Android TV, with few or no changes needed in the JavaScript code for the applications.

> **Deprecated.** TV support has moved to the React Native for TV repository. Please see the *README* there for information on projects for Apple TV or Android TV.
