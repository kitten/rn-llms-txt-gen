Stroke Width

# Stroke Width

## Usage

React Native does not have SVG components but universal SVG support can be achieved with 3rd party libraries such as react-native-svg. While these docs use `react-native-svg`, the concept applies to all libraries.

You will need to `cssInterop()` on these components to properly style them for native.
