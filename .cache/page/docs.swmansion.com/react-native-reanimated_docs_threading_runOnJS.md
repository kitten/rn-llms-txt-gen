# runOnJS

`runOnJS` lets you asynchronously run non-workletized functions that couldn't otherwise run on the UI thread. This applies to most external libraries as they don't have their functions marked with `"worklet";` directive.

`runOnJS` is usually used to update React state either on animation finish or conditionally within a gesture.

## Reference

```
import { runOnJS } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  // While on the UI thread
  runOnJS(navigation.goBack)();
}
```

### Arguments

#### fn

A reference to a function you want to execute on the JavaScript thread from the UI thread. Arguments to your function have to be passed to the function returned from `runOnJS` i.e. `runOnJS(setValue)(10);`.

### Returns

`runOnJS` returns a function that accepts arguments for the function passed as the first argument. This function can be safely executed on the UI thread.

info

Don't forget to call the function returned from `runOnJS`.

## Example

## Remarks

* Functions passed to `runOnJS` must be defined in the JavaScript thread scope, i.e. in the component body or the global scope. This code won't work because `myFunction` is defined in the `withTiming` callback, which is only executed in the UI thread:

```
withTiming(0, {}, () => {
  // myFunction is defined on the UI thread ðŸš¨
  const myFunction = () => {
    // ...
  };
  runOnJS(myFunction)(); // ðŸ’¥
});
```

* It's a common mistake to execute function inside of runOnJS like this: ~~`runOnJS(setValue(10))()`~~. Here, the correct usage would be `runOnJS(setValue)(10)`.

* It's safe to run functions via `runOnJS` on the JavaScript thread, as this has no effect.
