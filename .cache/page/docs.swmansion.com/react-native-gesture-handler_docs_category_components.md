# Buttons

Gesture handler library provides native components that can act as buttons. These can be treated as a replacement to TouchableHighlight or TouchableOpacity from RN core. Gesture handler's buttons recognize touches in native which makes the recognition process deterministic, allows for rendering ripples on Android in highly performant way (TouchableNativeFeedback requires that touch event does a roundtrip to JS before we can update ripple effect, which makes ripples lag a bit on older phones), and provides native and platform default interaction for buttons that are placed in a scrollable container (in which case the interaction is slightly delayed to prevent button from highlighting when you fling).
