# Force Touch Gesture

A continuous gesture that recognizes the force of a touch, allowing for tracking pressure on some iOS devices. The gesture activates when the touch force is greater than or equal to `minForce` and fails if it exceeds `maxForce`. A callback can be used for continuous tracking of touch pressure, providing information for one finger (the first one).

At the beginning of the gesture, the pressure factor is 0.0, increasing proportionally with pressure up to a maximum of 1.0.

There's no implementation on Android; it simply renders children without any wrappers. Since this behavior is only available on some iOS devices, this gesture should not be used for defining crucial behaviors. Use it as an additional improvement and ensure all features are accessible without this gesture.

## Reference

```typescript
import { GestureDetector, Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';

function App() {
  const forceTouch = Gesture.ForceTouch();

  return (
    <GestureDetector gesture={forceTouch}>
      <View />
    </GestureDetector>
  );
}
```

| `blocksExternalGesture(otherGesture1, otherGesture2, ...)` | Makes other gestures wait until this one fails or doesn't start.                              |
| `activeCursor(value)` (**Web only**) | Specifies cursor when gesture activates. Supports CSS cursor values. Default is `"auto"`.    |

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `manualActivation(value: boolean)` | When true, the handler does not activate automatically; state must be manipulated manually.  |
