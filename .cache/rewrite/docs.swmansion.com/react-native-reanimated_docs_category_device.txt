# Reduced Motion Configuration

The `ReducedMotionConfig` component allows you to modify behavior based on the device's reduced motion accessibility setting. By default, it disables all animations when reduced motion is enabled on a device. You can customize this for your specific needs. For more information, refer to Accessibility and `useReducedMotion` in Reanimated.

```typescript
interface ReducedMotionConfig {
  // Define properties or methods as needed
}
```

This component helps ensure that your application respects user preferences regarding motion settings.
