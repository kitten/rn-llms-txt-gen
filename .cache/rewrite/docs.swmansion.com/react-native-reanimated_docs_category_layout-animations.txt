# Version 3.x: Layout Animations Overview

## Entering/Exiting Animations

These animations are designed to animate elements as they enter into or exit from the view hierarchy, providing a dynamic user experience.

## Keyframe Animations

Keyframes offer a schema for defining complex animations. They provide greater flexibility compared to standard entering and exiting presets by allowing detailed control over animation sequences.

## Layout Transitions

Layout transitions enable smooth changes during layout updates, which may involve alterations in size or position. Both aspects can be animated to enhance visual fluidity.

## Custom Animations

Custom animations offer complete control over both entering/exiting animations and layout transitions. However, they are complex and challenging to maintain. It is advisable to start with predefined presets before opting for custom solutions.

## Skipping Layout Animations

The `LayoutAnimationConfig` component allows you to bypass entering and exiting animations when needed.

## List Layout Animations

With `itemLayoutAnimation`, you can specify a layout transition for list items during layout changes. Options include using predefined transitions like `LinearTransition` or creating custom ones.
