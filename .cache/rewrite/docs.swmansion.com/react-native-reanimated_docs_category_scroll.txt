# `useAnimatedScrollHandler`

The `useAnimatedScrollHandler` is a custom hook designed to provide an event handler for managing animated scrolling within React Native applications. This hook integrates seamlessly with various scrollable components, enabling developers to implement smooth and responsive animations.

## Usage

To utilize the `useAnimatedScrollHandler`, you need to import it from its respective library or module where it's defined. Once imported, this hook can be invoked within a functional component to obtain an event handler reference that is specifically tailored for animated scroll events.

### Example

Below is a basic example demonstrating how to use `useAnimatedScrollHandler` in conjunction with a React Native ScrollView:

```typescript
import { useAnimatedScrollHandler } from 'react-native-reanimated';
import { ScrollView, View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const scrollHandler = useAnimatedScrollHandler({
    onScroll: (event) => {
      // Handle the scroll event with animation logic here
      console.log(event.contentOffset);
    },
  });

  return (
    <ScrollView
      horizontal
      pagingEnabled
      showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
      onScroll={scrollHandler}
    >
      {/* Your content goes here */}
      <View style={{ width: '100%', height: 200, backgroundColor: 'red' }} />
      <View style={{ width: '100%', height: 200, backgroundColor: 'blue' }} />
      <View style={{ width: '100%', height: 200, backgroundColor: 'green' }} />
    </ScrollView>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, `useAnimatedScrollHandler` is used to create a scroll handler that logs the current content offset whenever a scroll event occurs. This setup allows for enhanced control over scrolling animations within the component.

## Parameters

The hook accepts an object with various properties that define how the scroll events should be handled:

- **onScroll**: A function that receives the scroll event details, such as `contentOffset`, and can contain logic to animate or respond to the scroll action.
- Additional optional parameters may include `onBeginDrag`, `onActiveDrag`, `onEndDrag`, etc., depending on the specific requirements of your animation.

## Benefits

Using `useAnimatedScrollHandler` offers several advantages:

- **Performance**: By leveraging React Native Reanimated, this hook ensures that animations are performed smoothly and efficiently.
- **Flexibility**: Developers can customize scroll behavior extensively through various event handlers.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing React Native components like ScrollView, FlatList, etc.

By incorporating `useAnimatedScrollHandler` into your project, you can enhance the user experience with fluid and responsive scrolling animations.
