import { withSequence } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  sv.value = withSequence(withTiming(50), withTiming(0));
  // ...
}
```

### Arguments

#### `reduceMotion` (Optional)

A parameter that specifies how the animation should respond to the device's reduced motion accessibility setting.

#### `...animations`
