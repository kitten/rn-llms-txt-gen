# Custom Swipeable Component with Scroll Functionality

When developing a custom swipeable component, you may encounter issues where scrolling does not function as expected. To address this, it is recommended to set the `touchAction` property to `"pan-y"` within your gesture detector configuration.

Here's how you can implement this:

```typescript
<GestureDetector gesture={...} touchAction="pan-y">
  ...
</GestureDetector>
```

By setting `touchAction` to `"pan-y"`, you allow vertical panning, which helps maintain scroll functionality in your custom swipeable component.
