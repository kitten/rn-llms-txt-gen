# LongPressGestureHandler

> **Warning:**  
> The old API will be deprecated in future versions of Gesture Handler. It is recommended to migrate to the gestures API. Refer to our upgrading guide for more information.

The `LongPressGestureHandler` is a discrete gesture handler that activates when a view is pressed for a sufficient duration. Once the finger is released, the handler's state transitions to END immediately. The handler will not recognize a touch event if the finger is lifted before reaching the minimum required time or if it moves beyond an allowable distance.

This handler utilizes `UILongPressGestureRecognizer` on iOS and `LongPressGestureHandler` on Android.

## Properties

The properties specific to the `LongPressGestureHandler` component are listed below. For additional inherited properties, refer to the base handler class documentation:

### `minDurationMs`

- **Description:** Minimum duration in milliseconds that a finger must remain pressed on the view.
- **Default Value:** 500 ms.

### `maxDist`

- **Description:** Maximum allowable distance in points that defines how far the finger can travel during a long press gesture. If exceeded before activation, the gesture is not recognized.
- **Default Value:** 10 points.

## Event Data

The event attributes specific to the `LongPressGestureHandler` component are detailed below. For more attributes from the base handler class, refer to its documentation:

### `x`

- **Description:** X coordinate in points of the current pointer position (finger or leading pointer) relative to the view attached to the handler.

### `y`

- **Description:** Y coordinate in points of the current pointer position (finger or leading pointer) relative to the view attached to the handler.

### `absoluteX`

- **Description:** X coordinate in points of the current pointer position (finger or leading pointer) relative to the window. Use `absoluteX` instead of `x` if the view can be transformed due to gestures.

### `absoluteY`

- **Description:** Y coordinate in points of the current pointer position (finger or leading pointer) relative to the window. Use `absoluteY` instead of `y` if the view can be transformed due to gestures.

### `duration`

- **Description:** Duration of the long press gesture, measured from the start of the event, expressed in milliseconds.

## Example

Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `LongPressGestureHandler`:

```typescript
const LongPressButton = () => (
  <LongPressGestureHandler
    onHandlerStateChange={({ nativeEvent }) => {
      if (nativeEvent.state === State.ACTIVE) {
        Alert.alert("I'm being pressed for so long");
      }
    }}
    minDurationMs={800}>
    <View style={styles.box} />
  </LongPressGestureHandler>
);
```

This example sets up a button that triggers an alert when held down for more than 800 milliseconds.
