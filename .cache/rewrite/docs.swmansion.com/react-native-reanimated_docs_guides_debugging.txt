# Debugging Worklets

## Overview

This document provides guidance on debugging Reanimated v2 worklets within React Native applications. Due to Reanimated's unique architecture and use of a secondary JavaScript runtime, traditional debugging methods may not function as expected. This article outlines compatible tools and their limitations.

### React Native Debugging Tools

The following tools have been evaluated for compatibility with React Native apps using the Reanimated library:

- **Chrome Debugger (React Native Debugger):** Utilizes a web worker in your browser to execute app JavaScript code, supporting all available runtimes in React Native.
  
- **Chrome DevTools:** Connects to a remote JavaScript runtime, allowing code execution on the device. Note: Not compatible with JSC.

- **Flipper (Hermes debugger):** Facilitates using Chrome DevTools and offers additional UI inspection tools. 

- **Safari DevTools:** Available only for iOS devices running JSC, similar in functionality to Chrome DevTools by connecting to a remote runtime.

- **React Developer Tools:** A standalone app for debugging UI through an inspector, monitoring performance, and profiling the application.

### JS Context vs. UI Context

Understanding the distinction between the JavaScript (JS) context and the User Interface (UI) context is crucial. Debugging the regular JS context remains unchanged with Reanimated; however, debugging the UI context specific to Reanimated can be challenging.

### Debugging Web Apps

For web applications, standard browser tools or any preferred debugging tools can be used without issues when employing Reanimated on the web.

## Compatibility Summary

| Tool | Platform | JSC | Hermes | V8 |
|------|----------|-----|--------|----|
| Chrome Debugger | Android | ⚛️ ✅¹ | ⚛️ ✅¹ | ⚛️ ✅¹ |
|  | iOS | ⚛️ ✅¹ | ⚛️ ✅¹ | N/A |
| Chrome DevTools | Android | N/A | ⚛️ ✅² | ⚛️ |
|  | iOS | N/A | ⚛️ ✅² | N/A |
| Flipper (Hermes debugger) | Android | N/A | ⚛️ ✅² | ⚛️ |
|  | iOS | N/A | ⚛️ ✅² | N/A |
| Safari DevTools | Android | N/A | N/A | N/A |
|  | iOS | ⚛️ ✅ | N/A | N/A |
| React Developer Tools | Android | ⚛️ | ⚛️ | ⚛️ |
|  | iOS | ⚛️ | ⚛️ | N/A |

¹ - Functions use web implementations, running worklets on the JS thread. Measure and Layout Animations are unavailable.
² - Experimental feature.

### Legend

- ⚛️ ✅: Special features for React Native apps using Reanimated
- ⚛️: Standard functionality with no worklet debugging available
- N/A: Not applicable in React Native apps

**Note:** Console logs will always appear in the primary JS runtime as `console.log` on the UI runtime is a wrapper around the JS runtime's function.

## Tool-Specific Details

### Chrome Debugger

| Platform | JSC | Hermes | V8 |
|----------|-----|--------|----|
| Android  | ⚛️ ✅ | ⚛️ ✅ | ⚛️ ✅ |
| iOS      | ⚛️ ✅ | ⚛️ ✅ | N/A |

**Summary:** Functions use web implementations, running on the JS thread. Measure and Layout Animations are unavailable.

### Chrome DevTools

| Platform | JSC | Hermes | V8 |
|----------|-----|--------|----|
| Android  | N/A | ⚛️ ✅² | ⚛️ |
| iOS      | N/A | ⚛️ ✅² | N/A |

**Summary:** Both contexts can be debugged. This is an experimental feature.

### Flipper (Hermes Debugger)

| Platform | JSC | Hermes | V8 |
|----------|-----|--------|----|
| Android  | N/A | ⚛️ ✅² | ⚛️ |
| iOS      | N/A | ⚛️ ✅² | N/A |

**Summary:** Both contexts can be debugged. This is an experimental feature.

### Safari DevTools

| Platform | JSC | Hermes | V8 |
|----------|-----|--------|----|
| Android  | N/A | N/A    | N/A |
| iOS      | ⚛️ ✅ | N/A    | N/A |

**Summary:** Available only on iOS devices with the JSC engine. Worklet debugging is supported.

### React Developer Tools

| Platform | JSC | Hermes | V8 |
|----------|-----|--------|----|
| Android  | ⚛️ | ⚛️ | ⚛️ |
| iOS      | ⚛️ | ⚛️ | N/A |

**Summary:** Functions as expected, with profiler and layout inspector available.

### Additional Notes

- **Console Logs:** Always appear in the primary JS runtime.
  
- **Known Issues:** Include reload failures, breakpoint issues on iOS, unresponsive consoles without animations, and more. These do not affect release builds or debug builds where the debugger is disconnected during a reload.

*Efforts are ongoing to enhance debugging experiences with Chrome DevTools and Flipper on Hermes.*
