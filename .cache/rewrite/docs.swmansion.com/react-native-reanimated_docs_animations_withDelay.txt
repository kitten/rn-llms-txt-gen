# withDelay

`withDelay` is an animation modifier that allows you to initiate an animation after a specified delay period.

## Reference

```typescript
import { withDelay } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  sv.value = withDelay(500, withTiming(0));
  // ...
}
```

### Arguments

- **`delayMs`**: Specifies the duration (in milliseconds) before the animation begins.
  
- **`delayedAnimation`**: The animation that will be delayed.

- **`reduceMotion`** *(Optional)*: Determines how the animation responds to the device's reduced motion accessibility setting.

### Returns

The `withDelay` function returns an animation object representing the current state of the animation. This object can either be directly assigned to a shared value or used as a value for a style object returned from `useAnimatedStyle`.
