## measure

`measure` allows synchronous retrieval of a view's dimensions and position on the screen, executed on the UI thread.

## useAnimatedReaction

`useAnimatedReaction` enables response to changes in a shared value. It is particularly useful for comparing previous values stored in the shared value with their current counterparts.

## useFrameCallback

`useFrameCallback` facilitates running a function during each frame update.

## useEvent

`useEvent` is a foundational hook that returns an event handler triggered by native events. This can be utilized to create custom event handler hooks, such as `useScrollViewOffset` or `useAnimatedScrollHandler`.

## useHandler

`useHandler` is another fundamental hook providing a context object and a value indicating if the worklet requires rebuilding. It aids in creating custom event handler hooks like `useScrollViewOffset` or `useAnimatedScrollHandler`.

## useComposedEventHandler

This hook allows for the composition of `useEvent`-based event handlers (e.g., `useAnimatedScrollHandler` or custom ones) into a single, unified event handler.

## dispatchCommand

`dispatchCommand` enables execution of commands on a native component directly from the UI thread.

## setNativeProps

`setNativeProps` allows for imperative updates to component properties.

## makeMutable

The use of `makeMutable` is generally discouraged. It's advised to opt for the `useSharedValue` hook unless you are fully aware of its implications and consequences (refer to the Remarks section).
