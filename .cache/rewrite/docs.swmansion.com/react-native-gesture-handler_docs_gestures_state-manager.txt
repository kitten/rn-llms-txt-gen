# Gesture State Manager

The `GestureStateManager` provides manual control over gesture states, requiring `react-native-reanimated` for synchronous execution of methods within worklets.

## Methods Overview

### `begin()`

- **Purpose**: Transition the gesture to the `BEGAN` state.
- **Effectiveness**: Ineffective if the gesture is already active or has finished.

### `activate()`

- **Purpose**: Transition the gesture to the `ACTIVE` state.
- **Effectiveness**: Ineffective if the handler is currently active or has finished. Activation may be delayed for gestures marked as `exclusive` until a higher-priority gesture fails.

### `end()`

- **Purpose**: Transition the gesture to the `END` state.
- **Effectiveness**: Ineffective if the handler has already completed its process.

### `fail()`

- **Purpose**: Transition the gesture to the `FAILED` state.
- **Effectiveness**: Ineffective if the handler has already finished.
