# Gesture States and Events

Each gesture can be conceptualized as a "state machine." At any given moment, each handler instance is assigned a state that may change due to new touch events or specific conditions imposed by the touch system.

A gesture can exist in one of six possible states:

- **UNDETERMINED**
  - This is the initial and default state for every gesture recognizer. After recognizing a gesture, it reverts to this state.

- **FAILED**
  - Occurs when a gesture recognizer receives touches but fails to recognize them due to certain conditions (e.g., exceeding `maxDist`). The state resets to `UNDETERMINED` after failing.

- **BEGAN**
  - Indicates that the gesture recognizer has started receiving touch input but hasn't gathered enough data to either fail or activate fully.

- **CANCELLED**
  - Triggered when a continuous gesture is interrupted by new touches or commands from the touch system controller. The state remains `CANCELLED` until it resets to `UNDETERMINED`.

- **ACTIVE**
  - Represents a recognized gesture that continues until completion (e.g., finger lift) or cancellation. Normally transitions to `END`, but if cancelled, moves to `CANCELLED`.

- **END**
  - Signifies the end of touch input for a gesture. The state becomes `END` and remains so until it resets to `UNDETERMINED`.

## State Flows

Typically, a gesture progresses from an initial touch event through recognition and acknowledgment of its conclusion before resetting to the initial state.

## Events

RNGH2 defines three types of events: `StateChangeEvent`, `GestureEvent`, and `PointerEvent`. 

- **`StateChangeEvent`**: Triggered whenever a gesture transitions between states, carrying both current and previous state information.
  
- **`GestureEvent`**: Occurs with each update to a gesture, including the current state.

- **`PointerEvent`**: Provides raw touch event data (e.g., screen touches or finger movements) handled internally before reaching callbacks.

### Event Callbacks

- **`onBegin`**
  - Invoked when transitioning to the `BEGAN` state.

- **`onStart`**
  - Triggered upon entering the `ACTIVE` state.

- **`onEnd`**
  - Called during transitions from `ACTIVE` to `END`, `FAILED`, or `CANCELLED`. The `success` argument is `true` for `END`, otherwise `false`.

- **`onFinalize`**
  - Executed when transitioning to `END`, `FAILED`, or `CANCELLED`. Similar to `onEnd`, with the `success` parameter indicating a successful transition. Follows `onEnd` if moving from `ACTIVE`.

- **`onUpdate`**
  - Triggered during updates while in the `ACTIVE` state.

- **`onPointerDown`**
  - Occurs when new pointers touch the screen, potentially involving multiple pointers due to event batching.

- **`onPointerMove`**
  - Activated when pointers move on the screen, possibly including data for multiple pointers.

- **`onPointerUp`**
  - Triggered when pointers are lifted from the screen, with potential information about multiple pointers.

- **`onPointerCancelled`**
  - Called when no further pointer information is available due to gesture completion or interruption. May involve multiple pointers due to event batching.
