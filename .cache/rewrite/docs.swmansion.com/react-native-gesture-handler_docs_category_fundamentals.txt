# Gesture Composition & Interactions

In RNGH2, composing gestures has been simplified compared to previous versions. There is no longer a need to create a reference for each gesture that depends on another one. Instead, you can utilize the Race, Simultaneous, and Exclusive methods provided by the Gesture object.

## Methods for Composing Gestures

- **Race**: This method allows multiple gestures to compete against each other. The first gesture to complete will be recognized.
  
- **Simultaneous**: With this method, multiple gestures are required to occur at the same time in order to trigger an action.
  
- **Exclusive**: This method ensures that only one specific gesture can be recognized at a time, preventing overlap with others.

These methods facilitate more intuitive and flexible gesture interactions within your application.
