## useSharedValue

`useSharedValue` is used for defining shared values within your components. These shared values can be utilized across different parts of the component tree.

## useAnimatedStyle

With `useAnimatedStyle`, you can create a styles object akin to StyleSheet styles, which allows animation using shared values. This enables dynamic styling changes in response to animations.

## useAnimatedProps

`useAnimatedProps` facilitates the creation of an animated props object that can be animated with shared values. It is particularly useful for animating properties of third-party components by providing them with animated props.

## useAnimatedRef

The `useAnimatedRef` function provides a reference to a view, which can then be used in conjunction with functions like measure, scrollTo, and useScrollViewOffset to manipulate the view's position or dimensions.

## useDerivedValue

`useDerivedValue` allows for the creation of new shared values derived from existing ones. This ensures that these new values remain reactive and update automatically when their dependencies change.

## createAnimatedComponent

`createAnimatedComponent` enables you to transform any React Native component into an animated version. By wrapping a component with `createAnimatedComponent`, Reanimated can animate any prop or style associated with it, enhancing the component's interactivity.

## cancelAnimation

The `cancelAnimation` function is used to stop a running animation that is linked to a shared value. This allows for greater control over animations by providing the ability to halt them when necessary.
