# Buttons

The Gesture Handler library offers native components designed to function as buttons. These components serve as alternatives to `TouchableHighlight` or `TouchableOpacity` from React Native's core library. The key advantages of using Gesture Handler's buttons include:

- **Native Touch Recognition**: They recognize touches natively, ensuring a deterministic process.
- **High Performance on Android**: Enables rendering ripples efficiently with `TouchableNativeFeedback`, avoiding the lag caused by touch events needing to return to JavaScript before updating ripple effectsâ€”a common issue on older devices.
- **Optimized Interaction in Scrollable Containers**: Provides native and platform-specific default interactions for buttons within scrollable containers, where interaction is slightly delayed. This delay prevents premature button highlighting during flinging actions.

These features enhance the user experience by ensuring smooth and responsive button interactions across different platforms and device capabilities.
