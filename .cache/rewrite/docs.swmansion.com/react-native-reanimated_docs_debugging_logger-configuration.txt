# Logger Configuration for Reanimated

Reanimated provides warnings to highlight potential misuses of its API, such as altering shared values during component re-renders. These logs can be adjusted in verbosity.

By default, the logger configuration requires no setup and displays all warnings and errors. To customize this behavior, use the `configureReanimatedLogger` function.

## Reference

To alter the default Reanimated logger settings, import `configureReanimatedLogger` from `react-native-reanimated` and invoke it with your desired configuration:

```typescript
import {
  configureReanimatedLogger,
  ReanimatedLogLevel,
} from 'react-native-reanimated';

// Default configuration example
configureReanimatedLogger({
  level: ReanimatedLogLevel.warn,
  strict: true, // Strict mode is enabled by default
});
```

### Configuration Options

- **`level`:** Specifies the minimum log level to display using a value from `ReanimatedLogLevel`.

- **`strict`:** A boolean that toggles strict mode. Enabling it results in additional warnings to help identify potential code issues.

## Remarks

* The logger configuration is global, affecting all Reanimated warnings and errors. It cannot be configured on a per-file or per-component basis.
  
* Call `configureReanimatedLogger` before creating any Reanimated animations, typically in the root file of your application.

* This function is intended for app developers. Library creators using Reanimated should avoid including this call in their source code to prevent overriding users' configurations with the default settings.
