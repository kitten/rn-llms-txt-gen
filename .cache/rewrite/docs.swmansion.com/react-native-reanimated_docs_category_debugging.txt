# Accurate Call Stacks

When debugging Reanimated code, you might come across error or warning call stacks that do not clearly point to the root cause of an issue. These stacks can be misleading because they frequently emphasize code from Reanimated's internal workings instead of highlighting the misuse of the Reanimated API, which is often the actual source of the problem.

```typescript
// Example TypeScript snippet for context (not part of original content)
function debugReanimatedCode() {
  // Debugging logic here
}
```

| Aspect                | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Issue**             | Misleading call stacks in error or warning messages.                        |
| **Cause**             | Call stacks often highlight Reanimated's internal code rather than API misuse. |
| **Impact**            | Difficulty in identifying the true source of problems during debugging.     |

Understanding this behavior is crucial for effectively diagnosing and resolving issues within Reanimated projects.
