# withRepeat

`withRepeat` is an animation modifier that allows you to repeat a specified animation a certain number of times or indefinitely.

## Reference

```typescript
import { withRepeat } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  sv.value = withRepeat(withSpring(0), 5);
  // ...
}
```

### Arguments

#### `animation`

The animation object you wish to repeat.

#### `numberOfReps` (Optional)

Specifies how many times the animation should be repeated. The default is `2`.

A non-positive value, such as `0` or `-1`, will cause the animation to repeat indefinitely until it is canceled or removed. For instance, if the component unmounts or `cancelAnimation` is invoked.

#### `reverse` (Optional)

Determines whether the animation should alternate directions with each repetition. The default setting is `false`.

This feature only supports direct animation functions like `withSpring` and does not work with other animation modifiers such as `withSequence`.

#### `callback` (Optional)

A function that executes upon the completion of the animation. If the animation is canceled, the callback receives `false`; otherwise, it receives `true`.

#### `reduceMotion` (Optional)

Controls how the animation responds to the device's reduced motion accessibility setting.

### Returns

The `withRepeat` function returns an animation object representing the current state of the animation. This can be directly assigned to a shared value or used as a style object returned from `useAnimatedStyle`.

## Remarks

* The callback provided in the fourth argument is automatically workletized and executed on the UI thread.
