# Linking Libraries

Not every application utilizes all native capabilities, and including code for all features would increase binary size. However, we aim to support adding these features when needed.

To address this, many features are exposed as independent static libraries.

For most libraries, linking is quickâ€”typically involving dragging two files, with a third step sometimes necessary.

**Note:** All React Native libraries reside in the `Libraries` folder at the repository's root. Some are pure JavaScript and require only a `require`. Libraries relying on native code need these files added to your app; otherwise, an error occurs when using the library.

## Steps to Link Libraries with Native Code

### Automatic Linking

1. Install a library with native dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install <library-with-native-dependencies> --save
   ```

2. **Important:** Use the `--save` or `--save-dev` flag. React Native links libraries based on `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in your `package.json`.

That's it! The next build will link native code via autolinking.

### Manual Linking

#### Step 1

If the library includes native code, an `.xcodeproj` file should be present. Drag this file into your Xcode project (typically under the `Libraries` group).

#### Step 2

Select your main project file (representing the `.xcodeproj`) and choose `Build Phases`. Drag the static library from the `Products` folder of the imported Library to `Link Binary With Libraries`.

#### Step 3

Not all libraries require this step. Consider:

*Do I need to know the contents of the library at compile time?*

This means, are you using the library on the native side or only in JavaScript? If it's just JavaScript, no further action is needed.

If native usage is required, include the library's headers by going to your project file, selecting `Build Settings`, and searching for `Header Search Paths`. Add the path to your library. (Previously recommended using `recursive` is now discouraged due to potential build failures, especially with CocoaPods.)
