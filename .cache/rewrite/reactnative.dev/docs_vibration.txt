# Vibration

This section describes how to make a device vibrate.

## Example

For Android applications, it is necessary to request the `android.permission.VIBRATE` permission. This can be done by adding `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>` in the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

On iOS devices, vibration functionality is achieved using the `AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate)` method.

## Reference

### Methods

#### `cancel()`

```typescript
static cancel(): void;
```

This method stops any ongoing vibrations that were initiated with a repeating pattern by calling `vibrate()`.

***

#### `vibrate()`

```typescript
static vibrate(
  pattern?: number | number[],
  repeat?: boolean
): void;
```

Initiates a vibration for a specified duration. By default, the vibration lasts for 400 milliseconds on Android. On iOS, this duration is fixed at approximately 400 milliseconds.

The `vibrate()` method can accept a `pattern` argument, which is an array of numbers representing time in milliseconds. If `repeat` is set to true, the vibration pattern will continue looping until `cancel()` is invoked.

- **On Android:** The odd indices in the `pattern` array specify the duration of each vibration, while even indices indicate the pause between vibrations.
- **On iOS:** All numbers in the `pattern` array represent the pause durations since the vibration length remains constant.

**Parameters:**

| Name    | Type                             | Default | Description                                                                                     |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pattern | number \| number[]               | `400`   | Specifies either a single duration for vibration in milliseconds or an array of times.          |
| repeat  | boolean                          | `false` | If true, the vibration pattern will continue until `cancel()` is called.                        |
