# TouchableOpacity Component

> For a more comprehensive and future-proof approach to handling touch-based input, consider using the Pressable API.

The `TouchableOpacity` is a wrapper that ensures views respond appropriately to touch interactions. When pressed, it reduces the opacity of the wrapped view, creating a dimming effect.

This behavior is achieved by enclosing the children in an `Animated.View`, which is then added to the view hierarchy. Note that this can influence layout.
