# Using Hermes

Hermes is an open-source JavaScript engine optimized for React Native. Many applications experience improved start-up time, reduced memory usage, and smaller app size when using Hermes compared to JavaScriptCore. By default, React Native uses Hermes without requiring additional configuration.

## Bundled Hermes

React Native includes a **bundled version** of Hermes. Each new release of React Native comes with a compatible version of Hermes, ensuring seamless integration. This change is transparent for React Native users, who can still disable Hermes if needed. Further technical details are available on the official documentation page.

## Confirming Hermes Usage

For newly created apps, check if Hermes is enabled in the welcome view:

A `HermesInternal` global variable will be present in JavaScript to verify Hermes usage:

```typescript
const isHermes = () => !!global.HermesInternal;
```

> **Caution:** If you use a non-standard method for loading the JS bundle, the `HermesInternal` variable might exist without utilizing the optimized pre-compiled bytecode. Ensure that you are using the `.hbc` file and benchmark performance as described below.

To observe Hermes' benefits, create a release build of your app:

### Android

```shell
npm run android -- --mode="release"
```

```shell
yarn android --mode release
```

### iOS

```shell
npm run ios -- --mode="Release"
```

```shell
yarn ios --mode Release
```

This process compiles JavaScript to Hermes Bytecode during build time, enhancing your app's startup speed on devices.

## Switching Back to JavaScriptCore

React Native also supports using JavaScriptCore as the JavaScript engine. Follow these steps to opt-out of Hermes:

### Android

Edit `android/gradle.properties` and set `hermesEnabled` to false:

```diff
# Use this property to enable or disable the Hermes JS engine.
# If set to false, you will be using JSC instead.
- hermesEnabled=true
+ hermesEnabled=false
```

### iOS

Edit `ios/Podfile` as shown below:

```diff
   use_react_native!(
     :path => config[:reactNativePath],
+    :hermes_enabled => false,
     # An absolute path to your application root.
     :app_path => "#{Pod::Config.instance.installation_root}/.."
   )
```
