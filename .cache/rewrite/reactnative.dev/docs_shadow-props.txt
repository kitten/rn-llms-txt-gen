# Shadow Properties in React Native

* TypeScript
* JavaScript

## Overview

React Native provides three sets of APIs for implementing shadows:

1. **`boxShadow`:** A View style prop that aligns with the web's spec-compliant shadow implementation.
2. **`dropShadow`:** Available as a filter function within the `filter` View style prop.
3. **Native Shadow Props:** These include `shadowColor`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowOpacity`, and `shadowRadius`, which directly correspond to native platform-level APIs.

### Differences Between `dropShadow` and `boxShadow`

- **Location:**
  - `dropShadow` is part of the `filter` prop, while `boxShadow` stands alone.
  
- **Rendering:**
  - `dropShadow` uses an alpha mask, casting shadows only for pixels with positive alpha values. In contrast, `boxShadow` casts around the element's border box regardless of its contents unless it is inset.

- **Platform Availability:**
  - `dropShadow` is exclusive to Android; `boxShadow` works on both iOS and Android.
  
- **Inset Capability:**
  - Unlike `boxShadow`, `dropShadow` cannot be inset.
  
- **Spread Distance:**
  - `dropShadow` lacks the `spreadDistance` feature available in `boxShadow`.

While `boxShadow` and `dropShadow` offer more advanced capabilities, native shadow props are recommended for straightforward shadows. Note that only `shadowColor` is supported on both Android and iOS; other shadow properties function solely on iOS.

## Properties

### `boxShadow`

Refer to View Style Props documentation for details.

### `dropShadow` (Android)

Refer to View Style Props documentation for details.

### `shadowColor`

Sets the drop shadow color. This property functions only on Android API 28 and above. For similar effects on lower APIs, use the `elevation` property.

| Type |
| ---- |
| color |

### `shadowOffset` (iOS)

Defines the drop shadow offset.

| Type                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| object: `{width: number,height: number}` |

### `shadowOpacity` (iOS)

Determines the drop shadow opacity, factoring in the color's alpha component.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

### `shadowRadius` (iOS)

Specifies the drop shadow blur radius.

| Type   |
