# DrawerLayoutAndroid Component

The `DrawerLayoutAndroid` is a React component specifically designed for Android platforms. It encapsulates the platform's native `DrawerLayout`. This layout typically serves as a navigation drawer, which can be rendered using the `renderNavigationView` prop. The main content of your application resides within its direct children.

By default, the navigation view remains hidden and can be revealed by pulling it from the side of the screen specified by the `drawerPosition` prop. You can also adjust the width of the drawer using the `drawerWidth` prop.

## Example

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

## Reference

## Props

### View Props

The component inherits all properties available to a standard React `View`.

### `drawerBackgroundColor`

This property sets the background color for the drawer, with the default being white. To adjust opacity, use an RGBA value. For example:

```typescript
<DrawerLayoutAndroid drawerBackgroundColor="rgba(0,0,0,0.5)" />
```

- **Type**: `color`
- **Required**: No

### `drawerLockMode`

This property determines how the drawer responds to user interactions. It can be set to one of three modes:

- `unlocked` (default): The drawer will open or close in response to touch gestures.
- `locked-closed`: The drawer remains closed and does not respond to gestures.
- `locked-open`: The drawer stays open but can still be programmatically opened or closed using `openDrawer`/`closeDrawer`.

- **Type**: `enum('unlocked', 'locked-closed', 'locked-open')`
- **Required**: No

### `drawerPosition`

This property specifies from which side of the screen the drawer will slide in. The default is set to `left`.

- **Type**: `enum('left', 'right')`
- **Required**: No

### `drawerWidth`

Defines the width of the drawer, specifically the portion that slides in from the edge of the window.

- **Type**: `number`
- **Required**: No

### `keyboardDismissMode`

Determines if the keyboard should be dismissed when a drag gesture is detected. Options include:

- `'none'` (default): Drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
- `'on-drag'`: The keyboard is dismissed as soon as a drag begins.

- **Type**: `enum('none', 'on-drag')`
- **Required**: No

### `onDrawerStateChanged`

A callback that fires when the drawer's state changes. The possible states are:

- `idle`: No interaction with the navigation view.

- **Type**: `function`
- **Required**: No
