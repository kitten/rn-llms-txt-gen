# Button Component

The Button component is designed to render consistently across different platforms, offering a basic level of customization. If the default appearance does not meet your needs, consider creating a custom button using Pressable. For guidance, refer to the source code of the Button component.

```typescript
<Button
  onPress={onPressLearnMore}
  title="Learn More"
  color="#841584"
  accessibilityLabel="Learn more about this purple button"
