# InputAccessoryView

The `InputAccessoryView` component allows for customization of the keyboard input accessory view on iOS. This view appears above the keyboard when a `TextInput` is focused, enabling the creation of custom toolbars.

To utilize this component, wrap your custom toolbar with `InputAccessoryView` and assign it a `nativeID`. Then, use that `nativeID` as the `inputAccessoryViewID` for any desired `TextInput`. Here's a basic example:

This component can also facilitate sticky text inputsâ€”text inputs anchored to the top of the keyboard. To achieve this, wrap a `TextInput` with `InputAccessoryView` without setting a `nativeID`. For an example, refer to `InputAccessoryViewExample.js`.
