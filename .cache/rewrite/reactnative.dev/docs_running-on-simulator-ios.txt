# Running on Simulator

## Starting the Simulator

After initializing your React Native project, you can start it using either npm or Yarn within the project directory.

### Commands:

- **npm**

  ```shell
  npm run ios
  ```

- **Yarn**

  ```shell
  yarn ios
  ```

If everything is configured correctly, your app should appear in the iOS Simulator shortly after running these commands.

## Specifying a Device

To specify which device to use with the simulator, utilize the `--simulator` flag followed by the desired device name as a string. By default, it uses `"iPhone 14"`. For example, to run your app on an iPhone SE (3rd generation), execute:

- **npm**

  ```shell
  npm run ios -- --simulator="iPhone SE (3rd generation)"
  ```

- **Yarn**

  ```shell
  yarn ios --simulator "iPhone SE (3rd generation)"
  ```

The device names should match those available in Xcode. You can verify the list of devices by running `xcrun simctl list devices` from your console.

### Specifying a Device Version

If multiple iOS versions are installed, specify the version as well. For instance, to run on an iPhone 14 Pro with iOS 16.0, use:

- **npm**

  ```shell
  npm run ios -- --simulator="iPhone 14 Pro (16.0)"
  ```

- **Yarn**

  ```shell
  yarn ios --simulator "iPhone 14 Pro (16.0)"
  ```

## Specifying a UDID

You can also specify the device using its UDID, which you can find by running `xcrun simctl list devices`. For example, to run your app with a specific UDID:

- **npm**

  ```shell
  npm run ios -- --udid="AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
  ```

- **Yarn**

  ```shell
  yarn ios --udid "AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA"
  ```
