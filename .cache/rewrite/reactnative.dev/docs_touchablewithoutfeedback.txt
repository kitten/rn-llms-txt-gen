# TouchableWithoutFeedback

> For more comprehensive and future-proof handling of touch-based input, consider using the Pressable API. Use `TouchableWithoutFeedback` only if there is a compelling reason to do so. All elements that respond to press should provide visual feedback when touched.

`TouchableWithoutFeedback` supports only one child element. If multiple children are needed, wrap them in a `View`. It's important to note that `TouchableWithoutFeedback` works by cloning its child and applying responder props to it. Therefore, any intermediary components must pass these props through to the underlying React Native component.

## Usage Pattern

```typescript
function MyComponent(props: MyComponentProps) {
  return (
    <View {...props} style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#fff'}}>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

<TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>
  <MyComponent />
</TouchableWithoutFeedback>;
```
