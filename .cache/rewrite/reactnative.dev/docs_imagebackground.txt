# ImageBackground Component Overview

The `<ImageBackground>` component is designed for developers who are accustomed to using `background-image` in web development. It functions similarly to the `<Image>` component, allowing you to layer additional content on top of an image.

## Considerations

While `<ImageBackground>` provides basic functionality, it may not be suitable for all use cases. Developers are encouraged to review its source code and consider creating a custom component if necessary.

**Note:** It is essential to define width and height style attributes when using this component.
