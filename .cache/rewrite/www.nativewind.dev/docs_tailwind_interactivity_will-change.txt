We are seeking contributors for the following task:

### Add `will-change-transform`

In scenarios where a component includes transition or animation class names, it utilizes `react-native-reanimated`'s `Animated.createAnimatedComponent()` to enable animations. If these class names are conditional, this can lead to the component unmounting because Nativewind may conditionally render two distinct components.

A suggested solution is to implement `will-change-transform`, ensuring that the component remains animated even when not strictly necessary.
