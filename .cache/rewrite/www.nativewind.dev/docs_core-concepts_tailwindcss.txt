# Built on Tailwind CSS

Nativewind is developed using the Tailwind CSS framework. Consequently, the fundamental principles of Tailwind CSS are applicable to Nativewind as well. It's advisable to review their documentation on:

- Utility-First Fundamentals
- Reusing Styles
- Adding Custom Styles

Understanding that CSS styles in Nativewind are generated through the Tailwind CLI is crucial, which means all features and compiler options of Tailwind CSS for web development are accessible.

This guide focuses on universally compatible features. However, platform-specific prefixes can be used to apply styles exclusive to web platforms.

## Supporting React Native

Nativewind functions similarly to traditional CSS by accepting all class names but only applying the supported styles. For instance, using `grid` will work in a web environment but not natively.
