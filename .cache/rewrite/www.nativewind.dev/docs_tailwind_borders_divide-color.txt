### divideOpacity (native only)

Due to performance considerations, Nativewind renders with the `corePlugin` `divideOpacity` disabled by default. This plugin enables dynamic adjustment of the divide color's opacity using the `--tw-divide-opacity` variable. Instead, opacity is set as a static value in the `color` property.

To enable this feature, add the following configuration to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```typescript
module.exports = {
  /* ... */
  corePlugin: {
    divideOpacity: true,
  },
};
```
