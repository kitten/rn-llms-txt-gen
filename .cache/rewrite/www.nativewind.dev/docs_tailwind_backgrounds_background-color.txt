## Background Opacity

For performance reasons, Nativewind renders with the `corePlugin` `backgroundOpacity` disabled. This plugin allows text to dynamically change its opacity via the `--tw-background-opacity` variable. Instead, the opacity is set as a static value in the `color` property.

If you need to use this feature, you can enable it by adding the following configuration to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```typescript
module.exports = {
  /* ... */
  corePlugins: {
    backgroundOpacity: true,
  },
};
```
