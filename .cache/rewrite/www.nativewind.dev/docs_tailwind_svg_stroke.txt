# Stroke

## Usage

React Native lacks built-in SVG components, but you can achieve universal SVG support using third-party libraries like `react-native-svg`. Although these instructions reference `react-native-svg`, the principles are applicable to other similar libraries.

To style these components correctly for native platforms, it's necessary to use `cssInterop()` on them.

## Compatibility

| Class                  | Support        |
|------------------------|----------------|
| `stroke-{n}`           | ✅ Full Support |
| `stroke-[n]`           | ✅ Full Support |
| `stroke-inherit`       | 🌐 Web only    |
| `stroke-current`       | 🌐 Web only    |

```typescript
// Example TypeScript typings for stroke classes

type StrokeClasses = 
  | `stroke-${number}`
  | `stroke-[${number}]`
  | 'stroke-inherit'
  | 'stroke-current';
```
