# Responsive Design in Nativewind

**Note:**  
The default theme of Nativewind is not specifically tailored for native devices. It currently employs breakpoints that are primarily intended for web applications.

Nativewind's approach to responsive design mirrors that of Tailwind CSS. For detailed information, please consult the official Tailwind CSS documentation.
