# Stroke Width

## Usage

React Native lacks built-in SVG components, but you can achieve universal SVG support using third-party libraries like `react-native-svg`. Although these instructions reference `react-native-svg`, the principles are applicable to other similar libraries. To style these components correctly for native platforms, it's necessary to use `cssInterop()`.
