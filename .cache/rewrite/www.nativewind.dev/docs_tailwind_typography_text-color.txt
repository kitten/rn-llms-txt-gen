## textOpacity (Native Only)

Due to performance considerations, Nativewind renders with the `corePlugin` `textOpacity` feature disabled by default. This plugin enables dynamic changes in text opacity using the `--tw-text-opacity` variable. Instead, opacity is set as a static value within the `color` property.

To enable this feature, modify your `tailwind.config.js` file as follows:

```typescript
module.exports = {
  /* ... */
  corePlugin: {
    textOpacity: true,
  },
};
```
