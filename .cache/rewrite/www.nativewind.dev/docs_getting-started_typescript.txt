# Typescript

Nativewind enhances React Native's type definitions through declaration merging. To incorporate these types, create a new file named `nativewind-env.d.ts` and include a triple-slash directive to reference the necessary types.

```typescript
/// <reference types="nativewind/types" />
```

**CAUTION**

Avoid naming this file:

- `nativewind.d.ts`
- The same as any existing file or folder in the directory, such as `app.d.ts` if there's an `/app` folder.
- Identically to a folder within `node_modules`, like `react.d.ts`.

Naming conflicts may prevent the TypeScript compiler from recognizing your types.
