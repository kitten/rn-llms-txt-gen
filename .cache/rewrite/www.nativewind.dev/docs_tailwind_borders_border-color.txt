### Border Opacity (Native Only)

Nativewind, by default, does not support the `corePlugin` feature for `borderOpacity`. This means that border color opacity cannot dynamically change using the `--tw-border-opacity` variable. Instead, opacity is set as a static value within the `color` property.

To enable dynamic border opacity in Nativewind, modify your `tailwind.config.js` file by adding:

```typescript
module.exports = {
  /* ... */
  corePlugin: {
    borderOpacity: true,
  },
};
```

This configuration allows you to utilize the `borderOpacity` feature.
