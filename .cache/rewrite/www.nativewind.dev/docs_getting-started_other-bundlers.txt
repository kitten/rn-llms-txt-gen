# Other Bundlers

Nativewind offers installation guidance for the two most prevalent React Native bundlers, Metro and Next.js. However, it is compatible with any bundler. To integrate Nativewind successfully, ensure these three conditions are satisfied:

1. Tailwind CSS must be configured using the Nativewind preset.
2. React Native should be set up, specifically utilizing React Native Web version 0.17 or higher.
3. The JSX runtime needs to be adjusted to `'automatic'`, and `jsxImportSource` should be assigned to `'nativewind'`.

## Troubleshooting for Web Bundlers

**Is TailwindCSS Configured?**

To verify if Tailwind CSS is correctly set up, render the following component:

```tsx
<div class="w-10 h-10 bg-red-500" />
```

A red square should appear if everything is configured properly. For setup and troubleshooting guidance, refer to the official Tailwind CSS installation instructions.

**Is React Native Web Configured?**

To test React Native Web configuration, modify your `div` as follows:

```tsx
<View style={{ $$css: true, test: "w-10 h-10 bg-blue-500" }} />
```

A blue square should be visible if the setup is correct.

**Is JSX Runtime Set to `'automatic'` and `jsxImportSource` to `'nativewind'`?**

To confirm this configuration, replace your `View` with:

```tsx
<View className="w-10 h-10 bg-blue-500" />
```

This should display a blue square if the settings are correctly applied.
